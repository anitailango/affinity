The scandal might not have received the attention it generated had it not been for actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman getting caught in the FBI’s net. If there are celebrities involved, the story must be important. As offensive as this scandal is, it is nowhere near the biggest college scandal in our history. Our colleges and universities have long been mired in ongoing scandals, but they are so common that we hardly consider them newsworthy. College tuition and textbook costs have climbed faster than any other component of the economy. At the same time, the value of a college degree in fields of questionable economic utility have correspondingly diminished. This has left many dropouts as well as graduates with large debt obligations and no real means to repay them. Some seventy percent of college graduates carry student debt, which now amounts to over a trillion and a half dollars. Part of this is the unintended consequence of easily available government-backed loan programs, and the propagation of the myth that a college degree translates into much higher income over a lifetime. Remove the scientific and engineering fields from the equation, and the myth crumbles as fast as the interest payments on student debt rise. About 44% of college graduates end up in jobs that do not require a college education. Many employers require a college degree where a good high school education would more than suffice. Colleges raised tuition knowing that students could easily borrow money. What started as a benign program ended up like many government programs causing disastrous effects not only for individuals but also for the entire economy. But there is another problem. Before we expanded the population base that colleges serve, it was possible for a student to go through college and acquire some fundamental and marketable skills in writing, public speaking, economics, and mathematics. Those skills once set the college graduate apart from the larger population even if the student’s major did not have a direct economic translation. Businesses did not always want graduates with business degrees, but they did want graduates who could write a coherent paragraph, speak extemporaneously, and understand how to do research and interpret qualitative and quantitative data. The dirty secret of higher education is that the ability to acquire those skills requires both above average intelligence and motivation. Those joint attributes are probably present in no more than fifteen percent of the population. Yet, colleges and universities are recruiting from about 65% of high school\\xa0graduates and telling them they can be successful as college students. More than half will not have a degree after six years, but they will have student debt. Many colleges and universities lower standards to accommodate students of lower ability and motivation and, despite this, many drop out because the experience has no attraction for them. This does not apply to all institutions. Elite institutions and competitive departments in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, even at otherwise non-elite schools, can continue to recruit top students, who will benefit from the experience. Dedicated and talented liberal arts students do acquire intellectual skills that will serve them in their careers. But those liberal arts students are the exceptions. The so-called “cake” majors absorb the intellectually challenged and motivationally limited students. The role of these departments is to create an environment where these students will feel successful and be pushed through toward a degree. Nonetheless, except for elite schools, the dropout rates reveal the scam behind the system. There is little that is secret about this. During finals, administrators are known to openly tell faculty, sometimes in writing, to remember the institution’s laudable commitment to retention and diversity. You do not need a doctorate to comprehend the meaning of such messages. Such departments are also sandboxes for playing at social justice and indoctrinating students in leftist ideology. They are forums for telling students what to think, not teaching them how to think. From the administrative perch, they are safety valves for students to act out, demonstrate, shut down speakers, and otherwise make noise while the real work of the university continues unimpeded. In some institutions, there is even a significant geographic distance between the engineering, science, and technical colleges and the rest of the campus. Real students in demanding programs have neither the time nor the energy to engage in demonstrations. Finding a computer science student at a campus demonstration is as likely as finding a pro-life speaker on a women’s studies panel. Part of the campus deception is to encourage minorities to believe that a college degree is a passport to social mobility. It is if you are qualified and accepted in a program that has some relationship to the demands of the economy. But a degree in “minority” studies, where you learn how to be a more engaged minority, is only slightly less useful than a degree in most of the social sciences. Entire departments and graduate programs exist to recruit a captive audience of students who largely will receive no intellectual benefit from the experience, but they will pay tuition and subsequently carry the burden of a student loan. More important, when the cultural auditors descend from Washington to evaluate the institution’s progress on “diversity,” these departments are the places to showcase both “minority” admissions and “minority” faculty recruitment. Of course, nearly everyone in academia has known for decades that if some are underrepresented, there are others who are overrepresented and must move to the sidelines. The lawsuit by Asian students against Harvard is decades overdue, and one hopes that white students will continue to launch similar suits. The problems confronting our colleges and universities are far greater than a single scandal. Higher education needs reform, starting with the imposition of standards, the removal of so-called “studies” departments, a commitment to open inquiry, protections of free speech from thugs who think the heckler’s veto is enshrined in the Constitution, and an end to admissions and hiring by ascription. When that happens, maybe, it will be worth bribing somebody to accept your intellectually challenged and unmotivated children. But in the current state of things, the efforts by William Singer and his clients was probably an unnecessary waste of time, money, and legal risk, without any likelihood of securing the payoff for which they erroneously believe a college degree produces.

He is currently a distinguished fellow with the Hyam Salomon Center.': 1,\n",

The anti-free press Media Matters for America (or as I called them a while back in this space, the Media Matters Fascists)\\xa0— they the far left wing group that has been repeatedly flagged for its anti-Semitism (as here and here) is out there again targeting another conservative media host. This time — again — it is Tucker Carlson. It seems that back in the stone age of the early 21st century Tucker said blah-blah-blah on some radio “shock jock” show and so, of course, all these years later — off with his head. We have written about this Media Matters game before. They are used as the tip of the spear in the arsenal of the Leftist State Media, the latter’s objective being to bring back their onetime monopoly on the news and just how and who gets to present it or discuss it. Tucker — in this case — stands in the way. So the idea is to get him. More of which in a moment. Recall that back in 2012 the founder of Media Matters, David Brock, wrote an entire book about his obsession with destroying Fox News. Titled The Fox Effect: How Roger Ailes Turned a Network Into a Propaganda Machine. Aside from pushing anti-Semitism, publishing articles on “Israel Firsters” — now they are all about defending the anti-Semitic Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar — the Media Matters Fascists are determined to shut down any and every conservative host on television or radio. I have written several times over the years about their campaigns to get Rush Limbaugh or Lou Dobbs or Glenn Beck or Sean Hannity or Laura Ingraham or Tucker Carlson (and who knows who else) off the air. Oh yes, eventually I annoyed them enough that they came after me, too. CNN, shamelessly, caved. In the case of Tucker Carlson, doubtless there is a special animosity because it is the Carlson-founded\\xa0Daily Caller that back there in 2012 did a deep dive into Media Matters. Since they wish to talk about Tucker Carlson — let’s re-fresh what the Daily Caller\\xa0uncovered about Media Matters. There was this\\xa0DC\\xa0story — bylined by…Tucker Carlson (with Vince Coglianese) that headlined: INSIDE MEDIA MATTERS: SOURCES, MEMOS REVEAL ERRATIC BEHAVIOR, CLOSE COORDINATION WITH WHITE HOUSE AND NEWS ORGANIZATIONS This story reported, in part, of founder Brock: “He had more security than a Third World dictator,” one employee said, explaining that Brock’s bodyguards would rarely leave his side, even accompanying him to his home in an affluent Washington neighborhood each night where they “stood post” to protect him. “What movement leader has a detail?” asked someone who saw it. Extensive interviews with a number of Brock’s current and former colleagues at Media Matters, as well as with leaders from across the spectrum of Democratic politics, reveal an organization roiled by its leader’s volatile and erratic behavior and struggles with mental illness, and an office where Brock’s executive assistant carried a handgun to public events in order to defend his boss from unseen threats.” Then there was the aforementioned story of the group’s anti-Semitic problem headlined: MEDIA MATTERS EXECUTIVE WROTE RACIST, ANTI-SEMITIC, ANTI-‘TRANNY’ BLOG POSTS That story began: A top executive at Media Matters for America and the principal activist in the “Stop Rush” campaign made racist and anti-Semitic comments and disparaged “trannies” on a dormant blog that he wrote just several years prior to his prominent liberal activism career. Blog entries reviewed by The Daily Caller show that Angelo Carusone made derogatory remarks about ethnic groups and used language to insult “trannies” and ugly “gays” that would be considered hate speech by his own organization. Carusone is the executive vice president of the George Soros-funded progressive advocacy group Media Matters for America, headed by David Brock, which has built a nonprofit cottage industry out of targeting conservatives in media and flagging their politically incorrect statements for coverage by mainstream media outlets. Carusone is identified by insiders as the lead organizer of the pressure campaign to intimidate radio host Rush Limbaugh’s advertisers, which accuses Limbaugh of bigotry. Carusone joined Media Matters after founding the “Stop Rush” movement in late 2009 and effectively leading the “Stop Beck” campaign against Glenn Beck. Since joining Media Matters, Carusone spearheaded the “Dump Trump” campaign to pressure Macy’s to stop selling Donald Trump’s products. Then there was this headline in the DC\\xa0that emerged in 2017. BROCKBUSTER: IS THE MEDIA MATTERS CHIEF SLURPING FROM A SLUSH FUND? That jewel begins: Media Matters chief David Brock has personally watched over and benefited from a scheme to hide donor identities that allowed progressives to funnel untraceable millions to initiatives against conservative and GOP causes around the nation, a complaint filed Tuesday with the Federal Election Commission charges. One could go on. And on. But the central fact is that it is past time for people across the media spectrum to stand up for free speech, a free press and oppose these anti-free press jihads that Media Matters and others in the Leftist State Media repeatedly mount from some troubled headquarters in a drive to intimidate or destroy outright both Fox News and any and all conservative hosts on television or radio. Last year when the target was Laura Ingraham, I wrote this column titled: An Open Letter to Conservatives on Laura Ingraham Today quite literally the only thing needed is to substitute Tucker Carlson for Laura Ingraham. The point stands. I wrote in part: By now it should be crystal clear to every conservative — no matter whether they are Pro-Trump, Never Trump, pro-this or anti-that — what is happening in America. Any conservative on television or radio or in fact with any audience of any kind, as in a speech invite to a college campus — is now a target for silencing.… Conservatives? If I may direct this question to conservatives everywhere, famous and unknown, isn’t it time to do something here? The hard fact is this kind of what Ben Shapiro accurately calls “fascism” will continue until conservatives collectively rally and say: Enough! So. Let me say it again. This time — once more — the target is Tucker Carlson It is time. More than past time, for conservatives to stand up and say: Enough!': 1,\n",

Moore’s and Cain’s attackers outnumber their defenders. But their defenders have the better argument. The Cain/Moore mutiny of the Establishment is a perfect microcosm of the existential crisis of modernity. Canadian public intellectual John Raltson Saul called this persistent existential crisis, in his eponymous book,\\xa0Voltaire’s Bastards. (Penguin Books, 1992.) That’s shorthand for a misplaced veneration of reason. Venerated reason has not performed nearly as well in practice as in theory. Better call Saul: The official Left would put most of our problems down to uncontrolled self-interest, as if they still had a clear idea of how to harness self-interest for the general good. The official Right would shrug its shoulders manfully, that is to say cynically, as if to imply that reality is tough. But manful cynicism is probably a disguised form of confused helplessness. And none of these contradictions have anything to do with reality. … We are now more than four and a half centuries into an era which our obsession with progress and our servility to structure have caused us to name and rename a dozen times, as if this flashing of theoretically fundamental concepts indicated real movement. The reality is that we have not moved beyond the base ideas of the sixteenth century which, for want of any better description, should be called the concepts of reason. This Age of Reason will soon have been with us for 500 years. With each passing day more ideas, structure and beliefs are hung upon the fragile back of these few concepts. And yet, even in their early days, they were not ideas of great breadth. What’s more, from birth they were based upon an essential misunderstanding — that reason constituted a moral weapon, when in fact it was nothing more than a disinterested administrative method. That fundamental error may explain reason’s continuing force, because centuries of Western elites have been obliged to invent a moral direction where none existed. Knowledge, of course, was to be the guarantee of reason’s moral force — knowledge, an invincible weapon which would ensure that society was built upon considered and sensible actions. But in a world turned upon power through structure, the disinterested consideration of knowledge simply couldn’t hold and was rapidly transformed into our obsession with expertise. The old civilization of class was replaced by one of castes — a highly sophisticated version of corporatism. Knowledge became the currency of power and as such as retained. This civilization of secretive experts was quite naturally obsessed not by the encouragement of understanding but by the providing of answers. This obsession with the providing of answers calls to mind an infamous anecdote about Montagu Norman, the first celebrity central banker, as recalled in Jim Grant’s review of\\xa0Till Time’s Last Sand,\\xa0a history of the Bank of England, from its founding in 1694 to the financially turbulent present: “We have appointed you as our economics adviser,” Montagu Norman, the longest-serving governor of the Bank of England, said to a brainy new hire in the early 1930s. “Let me tell you that you are not here to tell us what to do, but to explain to us why we have done it.” Here within the microcosm of Trump’s announcement of Moore and Cain the Voltaire’s Bastards syndrome manifests in two main criticisms. The first horrified indictment is that these candidates would undermine the independence of the Fed. The second is that they lack sufficient academic qualifications for the job. Neither criticism holds up under scrutiny. The independence of the Fed is one of the most durable tropes in Washington. It is also almost pure pretense. As Steven Solomon wrote in The Confidence Game: How Unelected Central Bankers Are Governing the Changed World Economy (Simon & Schuster, 1995): Although they strained to portray themselves as nonthreatening, nonpartisan technician-managers of the status quo, central bankers, like proverbial Supreme Court justices reading election returns, used their acute political antennae to intuit how far they could lean against the popular democratic winds. “Chairmen of the Federal Reserve,” observes ex-Citibank Chairman Walter Wriston, “have traditionally been the best politicians in Washington. The Fed serves a wonderful function. They get beat up on by the Congress and the administration. Everyone knows the game and everyone plays it. But no one wants their responsibility.” This claim of Fed independence has, to cite Saul, nothing to do with reality. It’s just a shibboleth of a misplaced veneration of what passes for rationality, a rationality that has failed for a generation to contribute to sustained robust equitable prosperity. When not in the grip of partisan frenzy, the left, the right, and the center (Wriston) actually agree on this point. As a center-left commentator for the\\xa0Washington Post,\\xa0Matt O’Brien, trenchantly wrote in “Yes, the Federal Reserve has enormous power over who is president”: The arc of the political universe is long, but it bends towards monetary policy. That’s the boring truth that nobody wants to hear. Forget about the gaffes, the horserace, and even the personalities. Elections are about the economy, stupid, and the economy is mostly controlled by monetary policy. That’s why every big ideological turning point — 1896, 1920, 1932, 1980, and maybe 2008 — has come after a big monetary shock. Think about it this way: Bad monetary policy means a bad economy, which gives power back to the party that didn’t have it before. And so long as the monetary problem gets fixed, the economy will too, and the new government’s policies will, whatever their merits, get the credit. That’s how ideology changes. Center-right John Tamny, editor of\\xa0Real Clear Markets, argues that “Presidents get the dollar they want. Always.” At RCM: The Carter and Bush presidencies weren’t certain failures as much as the dollar policies from both administrations ensured economic malaise. What’s crucial is that all this could have been avoided. Presidents get the dollar they want. Always. Will President Trump realize this before it’s too late? A second knock on Moore and Cain is that they lack the professionalism requisite to serve. To provide some context let’s take a good look at the Fed’s own track record. Ylan Q. Mui, then writing for the\\xa0Washington Post,\\xa0wrote in “Why nobody believes the Federal Reserve’s forecasts”: “Even the government’s official budget forecasters are dubious of the Fed’s own forecast.” This was a reprise of a note she had previously sounded,“Is the Fed’s crystal ball rose-colored?” “The big question is whether Fed officials can get it right after years in which they have regularly predicted a stronger economy than the one that materialized.” The Fed’s economic predictions are consistently wrong. Thus, what can one really expect of policy based on those predictions? It is not wrong of the president to express concern that monetary policy is too tight and strangling economic growth. Mui was not merely exercising journalistic cheek. In the New York Fed’s own flagship blog, Liberty Street Economics, we find — speaking for themselves\\xa0and not the Fed — an admirably candid observation by an assistant vice president in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Research and Statistics Group, Marco Del Negro, Wharton Ph.D. student Raiden Hasegawa, and University of Pennsylvania professor of economics Frank Schorfheide, “Choosing the Right Policy in Real Time (Why That’s Not Easy)”: Model uncertainty is pervasive. Economists, bloggers, policymakers all have different views of how the world works and what economic policies would make it better. These views are, like it or not, models. Some people spell them out in their entirety, equations and all. Others refuse to use the word altogether, possibly out of fear of being falsified. No model is “right,” of course, but some models are worse than others, and we can have an idea of which is which by comparing their predictions with what actually happened.… … In the end, we have shown that policy analysis in the very oversimplified world of DSGE models is a pretty difficult business. Contrary to what it may sometimes appear from listening to talking heads, deciding which policy is best is very rarely a slam dunk. This can only be interpreted as an admission of the fundamental unreliability of the Fed’s core analytic. Bravo for the dose of honest candor! Prof. Reuven Brenner has called our current system to account: [M]acro-economics is now [astrology’s] modern incarnation: Only instead of stars, macro-economists look at “aggregates” gathered religiously by governments’ statistical agencies — never mind if the country has a dictatorial regime, be it left, right or anything in between, or has large black markets, as Italy and Greece do, where tax evasion has long been the main national sport. So let us first forget about this “macro” stuff, whose beginnings are almost a century old, and offer a simple alternative for shedding light on the situation today and on possible solutions, hopefully demolish this modern pseudo-“science” once and for all.” No less than Hayek, in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech titled The Pretence of Knowledge, acidly criticized the economics profession for something he called “scientism,” meaning emulating the style but not the substance of the natural sciences. The Fed, with its many hundreds of PhD economists on staff is operating a pseudoscientific model. This is the\\xa0sine qua non\\xa0of the Voltaire’s Bastards syndrome. Is there a problem with this pretense? Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase, recently went on record as proclaiming that the U.S. economy should have grown 40% in the last decade, not 20%. The policies emanating from the Fed, with all of its impressive expertise, have not gotten the growth job done. We’re stuck in a “Little Dark Age” of economic stagnation. This upsets President Trump. As well it should. Whether or not one accepts Moore’s commodities-index target (I do not) or Cain’s belief in the gold standard (I do), their appointment and confirmation would be consistent with President Trump’s reported desire for better equitable prosperity. Moore calls himself a “growth hawk.” Herman Cain is a sure-enough pro-prosperity supply-sider.\\xa0Bring it on. Confirming Stephen Moore and Herman Cain would not undermine the Fed’s independence. There’s nothing innately partisan about equitable prosperity. Some of prosperity’s greatest champions, such as the late President John F. Kennedy and the former U.S. Senator Bill Bradley, have been Democrats. President Reagan was a Democrat until his party left him. So was I. Confirmation of Moore and Cain would position two vital voices to challenge the Fed to up its game by adopting a monetary rule better calculated to restore equitable prosperity than its current, beleaguered “Voltaire’s Bastards” louche practices. The United States Senate should not flinch from confirming Stephen Moore and Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve Board. © 2019 by Ralph Benko, the principal of the public affairs firm of ralphbenko.com, founded the Prosperity Caucus, was the lead co-editor of the most esteemed modern translation of Copernicus’s\\xa0Essay on Money, and serves as Editor-in-Chief of the Supply-Side Blog published under the auspices of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity on which Stephen Moore serves.': 1,\n",

The only surprise here is the flaunting. After all, wealth confiscation is what the left everywhere has always done. Once in power, it is the only way the left’s policies can survive. As 2020 nears and the pursuit of increasingly restive radicals increases, the politicians courting them aggressively seek more extreme positions. The fear of the “liberal” label is long gone and the “socialist” sobriquet is all the rage among those who rage. With the Marxist moniker come the policies. Higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations are already passé. It is no longer enough to tax the wealthy more via their income. Now the target is their wealth directly. Calls for such blatantly confiscatory policies are still shocking to most Americans. However, as we have been repeatedly taught by the left globally, such sensibilities are hopelessly out of step with the new “progressivism.” In one sense America’s left is right in its calls: The only shocking part is their explicit nature. Usually America’s left does not admit it aims, pursuing them instead silently. The left pursues confiscatory policies not just because it supports them in its own right — though assuredly it does — but because it inevitably must. The left always starts with enemies. The question is how broadly it defines them and how stringently it pursues them. The answer depends on the amount of power the left has. Depending on place and parlance, the left’s enemies range from “the rich” and corporations, to capitalists, the bourgeoisie, and “enemies of the state.” Confiscatory policies are aimed at them because, in the words of the bank robber Willie Sutton, “that’s where the money is.” Initially these strike a blow, but they also stake the left’s expensive spending policies. But the more the left’s policies are implemented, the more they fall short. If implemented broadly enough, the economy itself falls short. Regardless, increased resources are needed to make up the shortfall. The phenomenon is akin to the Laffer Curve, albeit beyond tax revenue alone. The economist Arthur Laffer described how increasing rates of taxation, once they hit the inflection point, actually result in declining tax revenue. This creates the potential for reversal: Cutting tax rates above their inflection point results in increased revenues. This observation can be applied to the left’s policies in toto. Entitlement programs continue to escalate — either through increasing benefits, increasing utilization, or both — until they become unaffordable, requiring additional resources or rationing. Subsidies become utilized until too costly and the product subsidized goes into short supply or is rationed. Regulations mount to an extent that the activity regulated becomes less available or less desirable. Given sufficient power, the left can inflict this across an entire economy. There is no shortage of examples of this happening in individual programs here, and no shortage of this happening economy-wide abroad. It is an economic tenet that resources are limited. It is a political tenet that the left’s reach is unlimited. The only way to square this circle is to take more through confiscation. Of course, even compulsion can swim only so long against the economic tide — as the drownings of so many socialist and communist countries prove. The left has never been able to solve the question why those being increasingly confiscated from would indefinitely consent to producing more. The overall effect is analogous to a farmer eating his seed corn. Faced with a disappointing harvest, instead of curtailing consumption the farmer decides to dip into the stock he should set aside for next year’s planting. When spring comes, he sows less, and when harvest time comes, his yield is even shorter. Repeating the cycle, each year falls shorter and shorter. Eventually, he has only enough to eat, but none to plant. So it is with the left. It must make up its shortfall from others — confiscating what it lacks — until all fall short. If this sounds preposterous, look back to the left’s own past — the Soviet famine of 1932-33 and Communist China’s Great Leap Forward — or simply look at its present in Venezuela and North Korea. Or take its programs in isolation and see their inability to meet demand or be self-sufficient. Without external subsidization, they fail. This is only new to America. Here, the left’s programs are subsidized from the general budget and the budget shortfall is borrowed. Hidden from view, there has been a quiet truce: The left pursues its course in incremental steps, accepts its subsidies, and in return does not explicitly call for confiscation. However, America’s New Left reject this historical accommodation and its incrementalism. Emboldened it seeks bigger prizes — a Green New Deal, Medicare for All — and its needs (and wants) bigger prey. Confiscatory policies are now explicit. To the rest of the world — particularly those who have endured the left — such confiscatory calls are all too familiar. Far from new and novel, they are very old indeed — both chronologically, and in the sense of being worn out. They trace back to the 19thcentury and were tried repeatedly in the last century. Each time they were miserable failures — literally — leaving those subjected to them in misery. Far from being “progressive” — today’s trendy attempt at rebranding — they are actually regressive. These policies are throwbacks in time, just as they are throwaways philosophically, economically, and politically. America has not known this in the sense of living it. Knowing it intellectually, that it actually occurred elsewhere, is not the same. To America’s collective mind, it has remained a foreign affliction — like leprosy or the plague — that does not, cannot, actually occur here. America’s only real encounter has been the momentary quadrennial contact with some crank running for president as a communist or socialist. At best, such candidates pick up a comparative handful of votes and curiosity. They are the crazy aunt who mercifully shows up only for major family gatherings. Only this time, she has brought friends. We have emotionally felt that socialism and its wealth confiscation could not happen here. It can, of course. These policies now being so candidly bandied about are exactly what it would look like. And these proposals are just the beginning of what the left will do, if given the chance. J.T. Young served under President George W. Bush as the director of communications in the Office of Management and Budget and as deputy assistant secretary in legislative affairs for tax and budget at the Treasury Department.

They never let go. It’s their religion.” She was describing how the Labour Party had been destroyed from within by a small minority of radicals. Thatcher eventually exploited this process, led the Conservative Party to victory over Labour, and became Prime Minister for eleven years. The Republicans will deliver a similarly humiliating defeat to House Democrats in 2020 if its alleged leaders fail to rein in their own cadre of fanatical leftists, the core of which consists of recently elected social justice warriors Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley, Rohit Khanna, Raul Grijalva, and Pramila Jayapal. But the internecine fight that preceded the cowardly revision of the anti-Semitism resolution into a denunciation of generic bigotry suggests that Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer may not hold enough sway over their own caucus to prevent it from self-destructing. Before their epic defeat in 1994, the Democrats held the House majority for no fewer than four decades. Yet, after 12 years in the wilderness, they clearly had learned nothing. After finally winning it back again in 2006, their irresponsible antics condemned them to the minority after only four years. If they pursue their current agenda for the next 18 months, they will be in the minority again after only two years. Not only can they not muster a majority to condemn anti-Semitism, their most visible members are unabashedly embracing socialism, and the first piece of major legislation, H.R.1, literally gives illegal immigrants the vote. The Democrat majority jammed that bill, ironically titled “For the People Act of 2019,” through last Friday. At a time when the voters say immigration is the most important issue facing the nation, this pernicious bill actually loosens restrictions on voting by illegal aliens. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996(theoretically) prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections, but H.R.1 permits them to vote in local contests such as school board elections. The GOP attempted to amend the bill so that only U.S. citizens can vote. The Democrats rejected this, of course, as Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) tweeted: Today I offered a motion to recommit #HR1 reaffirming that only US citizens should have the right to vote. Dems rejected it. Next time you go to the ballot box, keep that in mind. The future of their party is in cities like San Fran, where illegals can vote. Let that sink in. It goes without saying that H.R.1 is a classic Democrat power grab that attempts to usurp the authority of the states to regulate the voter registration process. It would vitiate the accuracy of registration rolls by automatically registering anyone who acquires a driver’s license, prevent election officials from verifying voter eligibility, and render state voter ID laws null and void. H.R.1 also takes the power to draw congressional districts away from the states, and requires inclusion of illegal aliens in all redistricting plans. Moreover, it violates the 1st Amendment so brazenly that even the American Civil Liberties Union bestirred itself: The American Civil Liberties Union, on behalf of its 3 million members, supporters and activists, opposes H.R.1.… We strongly urge the Rules Committee to allow floor amendments that would mitigate our concerns with the provisions that unconstitutionally infringe the freedoms of speech and association. Having thus used H.R.1 to unconstitutionally seize control over our elections, and presumably using that power to create a permanent majority in Congress as well as a series of compliant presidents, then the Democrats would get down to implementing their socialist agenda in earnest. First on the list will, of course, be the single-payer health care system for which they have yearned for so long. Dubbed “Medicare for All,” it will eliminate all private and employer health plans, and come with an annual price tag of $3.3 trillion. It will allegedly save us money pursuant to “lower administrative costs.” Yet even the Washington Post confesses: The public piece of the American health-care system has not proven itself to be particularly cost-efficient. On a per capita basis, U.S. government health programs alone spend more than Canada, Australia, France and Britain… expanding Medicare to all would not automatically result in a radically more efficient health-care system. Not coincidentally the latest version of this pie-in-the-sky plan was introduced in late February by one of the above-named Social Justice Warriors, Pramila Jayapal. It boasts 100 Democrat co-sponsors, and a number of Democratic presidential candidates have embraced the plan, including Senators Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren. The only Democrat who has shown reticence about a full-throated endorsement is Amy Klobuchar, who describes Medicare for All as an “aspiration” rather than an add-water-and-stir cure for what ails U.S. health care. This is also how she talks about the absurd “Green New Deal.” This brings us back to our six Social Justice Warriors. The Green New Deal is not, as most people seem to think, a plan conceived by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her staff to save the planet. It is, in fact, a program concocted by the Justice Democrats, the main PAC that supported the divine AOC and the other five SJWs listed above. One of its founders was none other than Saikat Chakrabarti, AOC’s chief of staff, who is facing scrutiny by the Federal Election Commission pursuant to a lot of “dark money” that has been sloshing around between the Justice Democrats PAC and a Chakrabarti-controlled LLC called Brand New Congress. Republicans will welcome confirmation that AOC et al., who have been so vocal about the political influence of “the Jewish lobby,” are just a new generation of Democrat grifters. That revelation will be considerably less satisfying to Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the party’s leadership. In 2020 the GOP will target 50 to 60 seats held by Democrats in purple districts they narrowly won during the last two cycles. Most of those seats will flip after AOC and her fellow travelers drag the party to the far left. The voters will associate the Democrats with anti-Semitism, socialism, and illegal immigration, and they will lose the House majority again.': 1,\n",

At the time of writing, the New Zealand city of Christchurch is reeling from an attack on Muslims by what appears to be a white supremacist. The death toll, still rising, currently stands at 49, with a similar number of injured being treated in hospital. The targets were Muslims taking part in Friday worship at two mosques in Christchurch, who were mown down by a man with semiautomatic weapons and evidently support by certain accomplices. The international news agencies are running hot with reports of the Christchurch attacks. Britain’s Sky News and BBC World are covering the situation in detail, as are the American chains CNN and CNBC. Al-Jazeera from Qatar is reporting in similar vein, interviewing witnesses, drawing on the perspectives of commentators worldwide, broadcasting certain images of ambulances rushing victims to hospitals, giving a voice to the New Zealand Prime Minister and police authorities, and a host of other details of reporting. All in all, the audience watching the reporting from living rooms has a distinct feeling of being at the center of the action, keeping up-to-date on the latest details, and living the tragedy with New Zealanders. On the other hand, stark differences can be noticed in the level of world attention devoted to another recent massacre in Africa. On the morning of March 4, Christian communities in three villages in Benue State in northern Nigeria were attacked by Muslim Fulani militants. Some 23 people were killed by gunshot and machete blows as the Fulani attackers moved unchecked through the villages. Three days later, a further attack on other nearby villages resulted in the deaths of another three people. Such attacks are by no means unusual; during the month of January, a further 70 Christian villagers were murdered in other Fulani attacks. However, these tragedies in northern Nigeria attracted little international attention. Sky News, BBC World, CNN, CNBC and Al-Jazeera were all silent with regard to these terrible events in Nigeria. As a result, the world’s TV viewers were left knowing nothing about the massacres in Africa, in contrast to the worldwide attention given to the massacres in New Zealand. Why the difference? One factor must be the different levels of accessibility to such events by the world’s media. Western locations are much better furnished with state-of-the-art media facilities which can record every moment of every action that takes place in Western locations. Hence the level of media coverage of the New Zealand tragedy, compared with the almost complete noncoverage of the tragedies in northern Nigeria. Is that all? Sadly one cannot help but suspect that attacks on Christian communities in Africa are not particularly newsworthy, whereas attacks on Muslim communities in the West (far less common) are much more newsworthy. Perhaps part of this is related to increasingly secularized media channels in the West, where sympathy for Christian suffering is at a premium. The fact is that in order to hear the detail of persecution of Christians, one largely needs to turn to Christian media sources, as it won’t get much airplay in the mainstream media channels. Of course the world should lament the tragic events in New Zealand. Of course the loss of Muslim lives is as appalling as the loss of Christian lives. But the relative disinterest among the international media with the ongoing persecution of Christians in parts of Africa is deeply troubling, suggesting far more than inadequate media access. Hard questions should be asked why the world’s media is so much more interested in a massacre of Muslims in New Zealand than ongoing massacres of Christians in Africa. Professor Peter G.

The idea is to keep asylum seekers south of the border until they get their day in court. It’s urgently needed to help border towns like McAllen, Texas, and Las Cruces, New Mexico, which are being overwhelmed. The same critics pouncing on Trump’s call to transport these asylum seekers to sanctuary cities are also opposing his Remain in Mexico program. For these cynical critics, nothing matters but politics. They have no real interest in providing relief to the border towns, American taxpayers, or migrants caught in the chaos. Over 100,000 migrants, including a record number of families with children, were apprehended sneaking across the border in March, many claiming asylum. The border towns are dumping grounds for them once they’re released from detention facilities. They lack food, shelter, or the ability to speak English. Las Cruces city officials put out a call on Saturday for donated blankets, clothing, food, and diapers. Shelters and churches are full, bus stations chaotic, and charities tapped out. McAllen Mayor James Darling begged for a “solution that does not involve simply dropping them off onto the streets of our city.” But like every option Trump has tried, including detaining migrant families in shelters until their claims are heard, the Remain in Mexico program is being challenged by a cadre of left-wing, open-border lawyers. Its future hinges on a ruling by the federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals later this week, and perhaps a final decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. In the meantime, migrants scrape together bus fare to escape the mess. If they don’t have family already here, they pick a destination they’ve heard is immigrant-friendly. Word spreads fast about which communities will welcome asylum seekers, house them, and shield them from immigration enforcement. For example, Portland, Maine offers migrants cash welfare, housing, and job training, and is considering letting them vote in local elections. That information has traveled all the way to McAllen’s shelters. Migrants hear Portland is the place to go. Now that Portland’s shelters\\xa0are overflowing, the same city politicians who boast about welcoming migrants whine that Portland shouldn’t bear the cost. Portland wants all of Maine to pay. Lesson: It’s easy to be big-hearted using somebody else’s money. Cost is behind a lot of the opposition to Trump’s sanctuary city proposal. San Francisco Mayor London Breed denounced Trump’s proposal as “just another scare tactic,” implying that anyone opposed to busloads of migrants must be a racist. But race isn’t the issue. What’s actually scary is the cost of sheltering busloads of needy people. As left-wing icon Cher tweeted Monday, “I Understand Helping struggling Immigrants, but MY CITY (Los Angeles) ISNT TAKING CARE OF ITS OWN.” And why should taxpayers foot the bill, when only about ten percent of migrants from Central America actually qualify for asylum? The rest are scammers. They sneak across the border, tell a border agent they’re afraid to return, and get released inside the U.S. Half never even complete an asylum application. They’ve gotten what they want, jumping ahead of those who wait years to enter legally. Word about how to game the system has spread, and now migrants are coming through the southern border from as far as Angola and the Congo. One Texas resident asked why “non-border states” can’t “help support” the immigrants with free emergency room services, schooling, and other costly benefits. Truth is, towns across the U.S. already doing that are strained by the cost. Trump’s Remain in Mexico program is designed to alleviate that problem. The more asylum-seekers Mexico shelters, the more money stays in American taxpayers’ pockets. So far only a few hundred have been returned to Mexico. Litigation stalled the effort. Fortunately, the Supreme Court has twice recognized a president’s authority to limit who enters the country, including under the guise of asylum. Trust the high court to uphold the Remain in Mexico program, bringing relief to border towns and U.S. taxpayers everywhere.': 1,\n",

I would, but apparently Congresswoman Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) would not. She thinks it is a perfectly respectful — and accurate! — way to refer to the 9/11 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. by 19 Muslim terrorists in 2001. She characterized the 9/11 attacks in this way just last month to a largely Muslim audience saying, “some people did something.” What the terrorists did, for those who might have forgotten, was murder 2977 people, injure countless thousands more, and cause billions of dollars of property loss. The Hon. Omar who is Muslim spoke of the 9/11 attacks in this vague and anodyne way for a political purpose. She was speaking to a meeting of CAIR (the Council on American-Islamic Relations) and she went on to say that, “CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something [italics added] and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.” As a matter of fact, CAIR was founded — for whatever reason — 17 years before 9/11 and since 9/11 there has been no discernible loss of “access to our civil liberties,” by which I assume she means Muslim Americans. Incidentally, CAIR is not a widely recognized humanitarian group, as its name would have you believe, but an unindicted co-conspirator in a terrorist financing case involving the Holy Land Foundation. Now, of course, the Hon. Omar is not a very well-informed person. Not only does she not understand what she is talking about, but when she talks she mangles the English language. She is a perfect representative of the Democrats’ core constituency, the moron vote. Nonetheless Democrats are scrambling to Omar’s defense. They are claiming that “the right” and President Donald Trump have incited violence against her. That they are guilty of Islamophobia and of politicizing a grave tragedy, that being the cowardly 9/11 sneak attack against not a military target but against unarmed citizens going about their peaceful business. It was even more treacherous than the Pearl Harbor attack. All the Democrats said pretty much the same thing, but my favorite is Pocahontas. She, sometimes known as Senator Elizabeth Warren, said, “The President is inciting violence against a sitting Congresswoman — and an entire group of Americans based on their religion.” I have not seen that the President said anything about “an entire group of Americans” or about inciting violence against any individual. All he did was send out a tweet showing the Hon. Omar addressing CAIR with her now famous line, “some people did something,” which the President repeated between clips of the burning towers, of the highjacked planes hitting the towers, and of survivors staggering from the destruction, many of whom were destined to die of toxic inhalation later, often years later. That day meant tragedy for thousands, perhaps millions. Whoever edited those clips has a talent for dramaturgy, as did President Trump when ended his tweet with this comment: “We will never forget! Bravo! Yet obviously the Democrats have already forgotten. They see nothing wrong with the Hon. Omar diminishing one of America’s great tragedies. Let her go on with her anti-Semitic posturing and her ignorant trivialization of American history. What does she think of Valley Forge and the sinking of the USS Maine? Is it all ancient stuff from a faraway irrelevant past? The millions of Americans to whom 9/11 matters greatly do not count in the eyes of Hon. Omar’s defenders. And apparently President Trump ought not to have responded with his tweet. The Democratic defenders of the Hon. Omar will tell us all how we are to respond to her outbursts. They will dictate for us what we can say and cannot say. I am not the only American who has had enough of this Congresswoman from Somalia and her defenders in the Democratic Party.

Regarding spying on Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, he testified as follows: ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR: As I said in my confirmation hearing, I am going to be reviewing both the genesis and the conduct of intelligence activities directed at the Trump campaign during 2016. And a lot of this has already been investigated, and a substantial portion of it has been investigated and is being investigated by the office of the Inspector General, but one of the things I want to do is pull everything together from the various investigations that have gone on, including on the Hill and in the [Justice] Department, and see if there are any remaining questions to be addressed. SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN (D., NH):\\xa0And can you share with us why you feel a need to do that? BARR: Well, you know, for the same reason we’re worried about foreign influence in elections, we want to make sure that during elections — I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal. It’s a big deal. The generation I grew up in, which is the Vietnam War period, people were all concerned about spying on anti-war people and so forth by the government, and there were a lot of rules put in place to make sure that there’s an adequate basis before our law enforcement agencies get involved in political surveillance. I’m not suggesting that those rules were violated but I think it’s important to look at that. and I’m not talking about the FBI necessarily, but intelligence agencies more broadly. SHAHEEN: So you’re not suggesting, though, that spying occurred? BARR: Well, I guess — I think spying did occur, yes. I think spying did occur. SHAHEEN: Well — BARR: The question was whether it was adequately predicated. And I’m not suggesting it wasn’t adequately predicated. I need to explore that. I think it’s my obligation. Congress is usually very concerned about intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies staying in their proper lane. I want to make sure that happened. We have a lot of rules about that. I want to say that I’ve said I’m reviewing this. I haven’t set up a team yet, but I have in mind having some colleagues help me pull all this information together and letting me know whether there are some areas that should be looked at. I also want to make clear. I also want to make clear, this is not launching an investigation of the FBI. Frankly, to the extent there were any issues at the FBI, I do not view it as a problem that’s endemic to the FBI. I think there was probably a failure among a group of leaders there, at the upper echelon. So I don’t like to hear attacks about the FBI because I think the FBI is an outstanding organization and I think Chris Wray is a great partner for me. I’m very pleased he’s there as the director. If it becomes necessary to look over some former officials’ activities, I expect I’ll be relying heavily on Chris and work closely with him in looking at that information. But that’s what I’m doing. I feel I have an obligation to make sure that government power is not abused. I think that’s one of the principal roles of the Attorney General. Coming from Barr, a most measured and serious man, this explosive testimony portends a bleak future for all those FBI, Department of Justice, and intelligence community operatives who used their official positions and enormous — bordering on limitless — governmental powers to undermine the presidential campaign of Donald Trump, and, failing that, to undo the results of the 2016 election. So it is that Barr’s description of the possibility of such political surveillance as a “big deal” is understatement of the first order. As “big deals” go, the stakes couldn’t be any higher. On cue, the Democrats and their wholly owned mainstream media subsidiary have tried to dull the impact of Barr’s testimony. One bedraggled party flak claimed on network television that, since Barr merely\\xa0thought\\xa0spying had occurred, he had not confirmed that it had really, truly and actually happened. And, resorting to the left’s default position on all things Trump,\\xa0Washington Post\\xa0columnist Jennifer Rubin has called for Barr’s impeachment. These unhinged responses to Barr’s testimony are similar to the type of desperate, fantasy-based gibberish you might expect from a barricaded man facing imminent death at the hands of a SWAT team. Clearly the left knows that, with Barr running the show, trouble is on the way. Although Barr tried to avoid making any definitive statements about the ultimate outcome of the current and future investigations, he did let slip certain tidbits that should cause many sleepless nights throughout what we in the Justice Department used to call the Seat of Government. In that regard, Barr effectively stated that the investigation would be to determine whether the Obama administration had engaged in electronic surveillance of the opposing political party’s presidential campaign and candidate without a proper legal basis. When Barr questioned whether the spying on the Trump campaign was “adequately predicated,” he was obviously talking about the unverified and salacious Steele dossier that was used to obtain FISA warrants to intercept the communications of Trump campaign associate Carter Page. Such an investigation will necessarily encompass the genesis of the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign’s bought-and-paid-for opposition research that constitutes the basis of the dossier, and its knowing, dishonest, and illegal use by James Comey’s FBI and Loretta Lynch’s Department of Justice to deceive the FISA court into authorizing the electronic surveillance of Page and by extension all of the persons in or out of the Trump campaign with whom he communicated. As we now know, in sworn testimony given in the United Kingdom, not even Christopher Steele would vouch for the dossier’s accuracy. And equally damaging, in testimony before Congress, FBI lawyer Lisa Page stated that, contrary to standard FBI procedure in counterintelligence operations, the Trump campaign, purportedly the target of Russian infiltration, had not been warned of the Kremlin’s nefarious efforts because the FBI did not deem the Steele dossier reliable enough to compel such a warning. Page’s testimony sets up an irresistible line of inquiry. If the dossier was not reliable enough to justify a warning to Trump’s campaign about the Kremlin’s plot, how could it even remotely serve as the basis for obtaining FISA warrants to spy on the campaign? By her benighted testimony, Page has framed the issue nicely and invited a full vetting of who, what, where, when, why, and how the dossier was used to dupe the FISA court. Barr also made clear that, beyond the FBI and Justice Department, the investigation will also be looking at “intelligence agencies.” This makes sense given that low level Trump campaign associates such as George Papadopoulos and Sam Clovis were approached by foreign operatives with CIA ties in an effort to plant the seeds of the Trump-Russia collusion illusion. As for the FBI, Barr made clear that, while he does not think that there is an “endemic” problem at that agency, he thinks that “there was probably a failure among a group of leaders there, at the upper echelon.” No kidding. And, of course, any investigation into the spying must logically and inexorably lead to the clandestine state-sponsored plot to unwind the 2016 election and remove President Trump from office. In short, the subject matter of any proper investigation will necessarily encompass the first attempted coup d’état in our nation’s history. So here we are. After suffering through Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ comatose stewardship of the Justice Department, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s underhanded machinations, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s protracted rear guard action to protect the anti-Trump deep state conspirators, the day of reckoning is at hand. Attorney General Barr’s testimony portends a long overdue cleansing of the government temple the likes of which has never before happened in this country. This will be history in the making. In ancient times, when nations reached such dramatic inflection points, there were poets, authors, artists, and philosophers who formulated, explained, and preserved for posterity the meaning of events and their impact upon their societies. As I listened to Barr’s astounding testimony, I realized that America was at such an historic milestone. Who, I mused, will step forward to explicate and place these momentous events into their proper context? Does America have a Homer or a Cicero to properly express the gratitude and exaltation of our fellow citizens at the approach of long desired and overdue justice? And then the answer suddenly came to me as my shrinking brain flashed back to the immortal words of that long ago anthem of righteous adolescent retribution, My Boyfriend’s Back, to wit: My boyfriend’s back and you’re gonna be in trouble\\n(Hey-la-day-la my boyfriend’s back)\\nYou see him comin’ better cut out on the double\\n(Hey-la-day-la my boyfriend’s back) Here’s a link to The Angels’ singing My Boyfriend’s Back\\xa0on the Ed Sullivan Show. Their performance is at once entertaining and seemingly prescient. As you watch them sing, imagine that they are making eye contact with James Comey, Rod Rosenstein, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, John Brennan, Bruce Ohr, Lisa Page, Sally Yates, Glenn Simpson, Christopher Steele, and all the rest of the conspirators. It’s pretty amusing. To a remarkable degree, the lyrics are apt and convey the mood of all of us who have had a belly full of the deep state. As for all of those swamp dwellers who have corrupted and degraded our government to this historical low point, let me paraphrase the best line in the song: If I were [them], I’d take a permanent vacation.

       " 'Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz has been one of Donald Trump\\'s most eager House boot-polishers, but issuing what appears to be an attempt at witness intimidation on the eve of that witness\\' public congressional testimony is a brazenly criminal act,\\xa0to the eyes of many legal experts. Hey @MichaelCohen212 - Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if sheÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99ll remain faithful when youÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99re in prison.  SheÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s about to learn a lot... This would amount to shocking behavior if it had occurred in the absence of an\\xa0ongoing House Republican effort to scuttle or sabotage the investigation into Russian election hacking. Republicanism, at least as practiced by its House and Senate members, is at this point little more than an organized crime ring. Which brings us to an intriguing little question about Rep. Gaetz\\'s would-be witness bombshell:\\xa0Just how is it that Matt Gaetz, Florida congressman, allegedly knows secret details of Donald Trump\\'s ex-lawyer\\'s home life? Who told him? And, specifically, to what purpose? Gaetz is not on the committee that will be hearing Cohen\\'s testimony; he is, in this context, solely a bystander. If Gaetz\\'s intent is to expose private information learned about Cohen in order to influence his upcoming testimony, he is doing it only as thuggery. (That said, the notion that any human being in Trump\\'s orbit could be shamed by the exposure of infidelity seems a bit much. Trump himself is accused of serial sexual harassment and assault, the very reason Cohen is set to testify to Congress is over hush money paid in an arrangement to hide multiple affairs, and the top tiers of the Republican National Committee are peppered with enough disgraced ex-executives to fill the tabloids many times over.) Who told Matt Gaetz about Cohen\\'s private life? Who might Cohen have confided in, if Gaetz\\'s information is accurate? Who gave Gaetz the information he is now using in his intimidation attempt—and did that person give it to him with the understanding that he would expose it? There are only two solid possibilities. The first is Donald J. Trump, the man formerly closest to Cohen and who has himself been aggressive in attempting to drag Cohen\\'s \"father-in-law\" into the legal fray. The second is the stupidest and most talkative of Trump\\'s legal strategists; as shorthand, we will call this group \"Rudy Giuliani.\" Knowing just how Rep. Matt Gaetz came to have this theoretically incriminating information would be key in understanding Gaetz\\'s actions here. It was shared with him by somebody. And it\\'s almost certain that it was shared by that somebody as a specific attempt to discredit Cohen\\'s testimony—or dissuade him from giving\\xa0public testimony at all. Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell immediately called\\xa0on the House Ethics Committee to investigate Gaetz for this seemingly obvious effort to intimidate a key witness in multiple federal investigations. He will likely be the first of dozens. And the Department of Justice itself is likely to want to have a word with Rep. Matt Gaetz—not just to probe his intent, but to determine just who, immediately before Cohen’s\\xa0public testimony,\\xa0was seeking to make this information public. ': 1,\n",
       " 'The U.S. Supreme will not take up the death penalty case of Keith Tharpe, a black Georgia death row inmate. He was sentenced to death in 1991 for kidnapping and killing his estranged wife\\'s sister-in-law, Jaqueline Freeman. That death sentence was handed down by a jury including a white juror named Barney Gattie, who made no effort at all to make is racism a secret. Gattie said Tharpe should get the death penalty because he believed there were two types of black people, \"regular black folk\" and \"n****rs.\" In his mind, the latter included Tharpe, and that type deserved to die. Despite this blatant\\xa0racism from a juror, no court has ever heard Tharpe\\'s claim that he was subject to racial bias and now no court ever will. The Supreme Court turned the case away, clearing the state of Georgia to schedule his execution. \"Today’s decision from the U.S. Supreme Court takes giant steps backwards from the Court\\'s longstanding commitment to eradicating the pernicious effects of racial discrimination,\" Marcy Widder, a lawyer for Tharpe, said in a statement. \"What happened in Mr. Tharpe\\'s death penalty case was wrong.\" It was wrong, and though the court was unanimous in turning the case away, Justice Sonia Sotomayor made clear in her concurring statement that while she was \"profoundly troubled by the underlying facts of the case,\" the court had to make its decision based on a procedural issue—whether the racial bias claim was made in a timely manner. That delay was in part caused by the state of Georgia itself. By the time his case made it to the 11th Circuit court of appeals in 2010, the court decided that the delays caused by the state meant that his racial bias claim wasn\\'t raised early enough to be taken into consideration. In 2018, the case came back before the 11th Circuit after a Supreme Court stay of execution. The lower court decided again that Tharpe was barred from raising the racial bias claim. That reconsideration done, the Supreme Court wouldn\\'t take the claim on. America, where white supremacists can still kill people of color and do it with the approval of the Supreme Court. ': 1,\n",
       " 'The Gold Star widower who was deported and then returned to the U.S. by the Trump administration recalled that as many as half a dozen Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, “with guns drawn,” swarmed\\xa0his car to arrest him in the dawn hours. The dad, who has no criminal record,\\xa0was on his way to work. Three days later, he was dumped in a country he had not visited in 15 years. Jose Gonzalez Carranza spoke out\\xa0about his ordeal, expressing disbelief at how he could be so cruelly targeted after his wife gave her life in service of her country.\\xa0Army Pfc. Barbara Vieyra was killed in Afghanistan a decade ago. She was just 22.\\xa0\"’I feel bad because President (Donald) Trump says he wants to help’\\xa0people who fight for the country,” the\\xa0Arizona Republic reported,\\xa0“’but then why does he want to kick people out when his wife sacrificed,’ Gonzalez Carranza said.” But in fact ICE intentionally targeted this dad, reopening his case last year even though he’d had permission to stay here following Vieyra’s death.\\xa0Gonzalez Carranza said he never got the notice to appear in court because ICE mailed it to the wrong address, and his failure to appear then triggered his deportation. But according to his attorney,\\xa0“Gonzalez Carranza shouldn\\'t have been deported because on the day he was arrested, he filed a motion to reopen his case, which triggered an automatic stay of removal.” Gonzalez Carranza lived at a shelter for deported U.S. veterans as he waited for word\\xa0about any chance to return to the U.S. That came when his attorney, Ezequiel Hernandez, sent out a news blast, with subsequent reporting leading to widespread outrage. ICE won’t admit\\xa0it, but it was publicly shamed into returning him\\xa0to the U.S. ICE remains responsible, because Gonzalez Carranza could still be vulnerable to deportation. “If the judge reopens the case, Hernandez will ask for his parole in place to be reinstated.” But\\xa0Gonzalez Carranza is most concerned about his daughter, 12-year-old\\xa0Evelyn. \"It\\'s been hard for her growing up without her mother,\" he said. \"It\\'s been completely hard.\" Evelyn’s grandparents share joint custody of the girl with her father, so she was with them while\\xa0Gonzalez Carranza was gone. The girl has not yet been told about what happened to her dad.\\xa0\"I didn\\'t tell her nothing. I don\\'t want to make … her feelings be more frustrated, like I don\\'t have a mom, and now I may never see my dad again.\" “I\\xa0think the new president, the only thing he wants to do is deport people for no reason,” he continued. “I know there are bad people in America, good people in America. But he only thinks, if you are illegal, you are going out. He never thinks about what happened with the families ... or if the people contribute to his country to be better.\" ': 1,\n",
       " 'One of the many hopes of a Medicare-for-all program is that in giving our government a larger share of the medical “market”\\xa0(for lack of a better term), Americans—collectively—will be able to negotiate down the skyrocketing costs of medicine. Every day brings tragic stories of Americans\\xa0young and old, of all racial backgrounds, dying after rationing their insulin—the result of explosive increases in the costs of the drug. While some people’s diabetes treatments have risen from $24 to $80 per vial over the past decade, others face much more prohibitive prices.\\xa0As diabetes patient\\xa0Alec Raeshawn Smith’s mother\\xa0told NPR in September, her son’s\\xa0monthly bill for insulin and related supplies was around $1,300 without insurance—something he and his family could not afford. He died, having most likely been\\xa0rationing a lifesaving medication he could not afford. These aren’t outliers. According to a study by Yale University researchers, 1 in 4 people with diabetes are rationing their prescriptions.\\xa0This is not a new phenomenon, but one that is getting worse with the continuing rise in drug costs. The most severe cost of insulin deprivation is death, but people who survive with diabetes have to deal with the stresses brought about by rising and falling blood sugar levels. These can include passing out, losing one’s ability to control their temper, nausea, and dizziness. A woman recounted to the New Yorker’s Amanda Schaffer how she and her sister, who both have Type 1 diabetes, have shared and rationed their insulin\\xa0due to its rising costs. It’s something that has driven her life, leading to her dropping out of college her first year:\\xa0“I lost a lot of weight that year, about twenty pounds. When you don’t have insulin, you can’t eat much because you can’t correct your blood sugar. So I was barely eating. I was supposed to take four to five shots of insulin a day, and I was only taking two to three. I was lethargic all the time. I was rationing just so I could live. I knew if I ran out I wouldn’t survive more than a few days. That took a mental toll.” The solution is cheaper insulin. The problem, as Audrey Farley writes in the Washington Post, is that many people are hoping that older types of cheaper insulin are the solution—they just need to go to Walmart! The problem with using older forms of insulin is that the level of planning for adults and children can be unrealistic, as the older, slower-acting forms must be taken well in advance of eating meals. The costs of older, slow-acting insulins may be less, but the possibility of error on the part of patients is much higher. When Trump breaks his campaign promises about lowering drug prices, he’s not simply being a corrupt liar—he’s complicit in our growing public health crises. ': 1,\n",
       " 'The\\xa0Internet Research Agency (IRA) is one of the Russian agencies involved in the country’s\\xa0all-too-successful 2016 efforts to support Donald Trump and wreck the U.S.\\xa0election system. Their role in the affair has already earned both the IRA and many of those who lead it a hefty set of charges\\xa0from Robert Mueller and the special counsel’s office, including charges of conspiracy\\xa0to defraud\\xa0the United States. But on Election Day 2018, the IRA’s\\xa0ongoing role in election interference earned them something else—a direct attack from the NSA’s Cyber Command. As the Washington Post reports, U.S.\\xa0Cyber Command fired more than a warning shot across IRA’s bow, demonstrating an ability to completely shut down the state-sponsored hackers by taking away their internet access. “They basically took the IRA offline,” according to one individual familiar with the matter who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified information. “They shut ‘em down.” Experts were not sure if the demonstration would have any lasting effect on Russia’s tactics, and it’s not clear that anything has really changed post-attack. The IRA still seems to be active in, among other things, cyber intrusion and using both human and bot trolls to direct social media conversations. That’s been true in both the U.S.\\xa0where bots have been important in boosting stories that seek to divide Democrats, and in the U.K.,\\xa0where the IRA is amplifying the confusion around Brexit.\\xa0There are also concerns from some that, having demonstrated to Russia that it can take action, Russia will surely move to safeguard its efforts against this specific form\\xa0 of attack. But the bigger question should be: What\\xa0took so long? Why, if they had the capability to disrupt the IRA (and the IRA was a known instigator in 2016), did the NSA not move to take the IRA and related groups offline when it could have had the most impact in securing democracy? U.S.\\xa0Cyber Command began another effort in the month before the 2018 election. It began sending direct messages and emails to the accounts of Russian operatives informing them that they were known instigators, and that Cyber Command was aware of their activities. The Russians were shown that the NSA had connected their online accounts and their real names. That effort seems to have generated a fair amount of paranoia within the IRA, and created an “internal investigation” to find potential leakers. In any case, the 2018 elections seemed to be much less hampered by efforts to intrude into local and state election information, disrupt elections through planted stories and targeted ads, and false fronts masquerading as U.S.\\xa0interest groups. So the cyber attacks may have been successful … Or they could have been a minor skirmish in a war where the next major battle is less than two years away. ': 1,\n",

When Trump\\'s former lawyer/fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to making illegal hush money payments at the direction of Trump to silence two women, the sentencing recommendation sent shockwaves through legal circles\\xa0because it alleged that a sitting president, or \"Individual 1,\" had committed a felony. Trump has reportedly always viewed federal investigators in Manhattan as his biggest threat, since they have jurisdiction over his family business, his now-closed foundation, and even his campaign because\\xa0it\\'s headquartered at Trump Tower in the city. And whatever hazards Robert Mueller\\'s Russia probe holds for Trump and his inner circle, the ongoing investigations elsewhere are likely to hold far more legal jeopardy of the criminal variety\\xa0over time, especially if Trump doesn\\'t win re-election. Trump is reportedly keenly aware of the legal “hellscape”\\xa0he\\'s facing beyond Mueller, according to the Daily Beast, and late last year he began encouraging his legal team to stick around even after Mueller concludes his investigation. Here are several areas of legal jeopardy that will continue\\xa0hanging over Trump, his family, and his associates, no matter what happens with Mueller: In addition to all that, the Mueller investigation itself could continue to be its own wild card. Even after the special counsel delivers his report, a slate of sealed indictments filed in the D.C. federal courthouse might actually outlive Mueller\\'s appointment.

The Senate, too, can find not much to say about the attack. That leaves the House, which conveniently is now under the control of a party that does not have to hedge its\\xa0statements on violent white nationalism for fear of upsetting a conservative white nationalist base. Erin Banco and Sam Stein report that House Judiciary Committee Democrats will be reigniting a much-needed discussion of far-right extremism by holding the first hearing in years on the violent white nationalist movement. For about a decade now Republicans (and Fox News) have met government attempts to combat far-right terrorism with furious outrage, claiming as usual that their views as conservatives are under federal attack by such efforts. In the earliest days of the Obama administration,\\xa0the Department of Homeland Security issued a report warning of\\xa0the elevated threat of right-wing terrorism—and was\\xa0met with such universal Republican condemnation that it was\\xa0forced to then apologize for issuing that warning, despite its obvious truth and despite far-right violence now far outpacing violent acts by other terrorist groups. Republicans have blocked and belittled further efforts to investigate, disrupt,\\xa0and prosecute far-right extremists ever since, all under the same apparent belief\\xa0that investigating violent far-right groups would infringe too conspicuously on their own base. That will likely continue, but House Democrats are not as likely to go along with the Republican efforts as they were 10\\xa0years and many terrorist attacks ago.

But will the Trump Supreme Court use this case to crack down on racially biased prosecutions, or will it use this case to give prosecutors free rein to assemble white juries to convict black people despite weak evidence? A separate challenge to Flowers’ conviction, by the way, focuses on the weak evidence used against him, including a jailhouse informant’s recantation of a claim that Flowers confessed to him.

       " 'Sen. Elizabeth Warren is attempting to distinguish herself in the Democratic race for the presidency by leaning on her core strength: detailed policy proposals to overhaul everything from corporate and banking laws to federal lobbying rules. At CNN-hosted town hall in Jackson, Mississippi, she also voiced support for a much more ambitious reform: Doing away with the Electoral College. The discrepancy between popular vote and Electoral College results has become a hot topic, after elections in both 2000 and 2016 awarded the presidency to the candidate with fewer nationwide votes, and reformers have long argued that it has outlived its original purpose. It is a result of a tape-and-twine constitutional system aimed as much at protecting the privileges of smaller states over the will of the broader electorate (see: Senate) and of 18th-century communications limitations. The ability now exists to count, accurately and in short order, the tally of votes nationwide; the reasons for not doing so remain political, not technological. But it would require an amendment to the Constitution, a tricky thing to attempt in an age where attempts to reform the Constitution are as likely to produce a conservative demand that nuclear short-range missiles be classified as home defense weapons as they are to produce voter protections aimed at undoing the now far unbalanced privileges of the least populated states. In the meantime, twelve states and the District of Columbia have signed an interstate compact to pledge their electoral votes to the winner of the nationwide popular vote—an attempt to ensure the Electoral College vote mirrors the will of American voters by joint pledge, even if there is no constitutional requirement that it do so.

Liz Johnstone We\\'re closing down our live blog for the evening. Thanks for staying with us today. If you missed any part of the action, catch up by scrolling down through the blog for key moments, fiery exchanges and real-time analysis. Watch the highlights below, or check out the best lines from the hearing here. See you all next time. Lauren Egan A round-up of who in the 2020 Democratic presidential field chimed in, what they said, and who stayed quiet: Kirsten Gillibrand: The New York senator\\xa0wrote on Twitter that a presidential campaign “should never be in the business of scheming with foreign adversaries to tamper with our elections. I just thought that went without saying.” She also tweeted screenshots of two articles, one of which was titled “Michael Cohen To Face Tough Questioning From House Oversight Committee.” Gillibrand added her own take: “Elections matter.” Amy Klobuchar: \\xa0Of the 2020 candidates, the Minnesota senator offered the most direct comments on the hearing, highlighting several articles on Cohen\\'s testimony on Twitter:\\xa0“This is a big deal: Michael Cohen says President Trump was involved in a hush money scheme. …\\xa0This is even a bigger deal: \\xa0Cohen has alleged that Trump knew in advance that the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks planned to publish hacked Democratic National Committee emails.” She also tweeted about Cohen acknowledging he \"lied under oath to Congress\" about talks on a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Elizabeth Warren: The Massachusetts senator did not address Cohen directly, but she did author a blog post on Medium as the hearing was underway in which she vowed, \"If I’m elected President of the United States, there will be no pardons for anyone implicated in these investigations.\" Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julián Castro, John Delaney, Tulsi Gabbard, Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders\\xa0were all active on Twitter, but they stayed quiet about Cohen\\'s testimony. Ben Kesslen After Cohen\\'s hearing came to a close, legal experts — as well as a former adviser to Trump\\'s campaign — said they found Cohen a \"credible\" witness despite his own admitted lies and crimes. \"I think Cohen came across as very credible,\" Mimi Rocah, a former prosecutor for the Southern District of New York and an NBC News and MSNBC legal analyst, said on \"Meet the Press Daily.\" Rocah emphasized that Cohen didn\\'t \"go too far\" in his testimony. \"He tells us when he knows something and he doesn\\'t\\xa0try to implicate\\xa0people in\\xa0something that he can\\'t,\" she said. Sam Nunberg, a former adviser\\xa0to Trump\\'s 2016 campaign, agreed, and added he thinks Trump\\xa0\"hated today more than losing the shutdown.\" Ben Wittes, editor-in-chief of Lawfare and a legal analyst for NBC News and MSNBC, said his big takeaway is that Cohen\\'s testimony will now aid in\\xa0\"creating an agenda\" for the next Oversight hearing. \"The\\xa0committee\\xa0is getting a huge number of tips and leads of who else they should be talking to,\" Wittes said. \"They emerged from this with a giant witness list.\" Allan Smith and Kristen Welker Jay Sekulow, a member of Trump\\'s legal team, pushed back on a part of Cohen\\'s testimony after the hearing wrapped. \"Today’s testimony by Michael Cohen that attorneys for the president edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false,\" Sekulow said in a statement. During Wednesday\\'s public hearing, Cohen testified that Sekulow was among the lawyers who reviewed his previous prepared remarks to Congress regarding the\\xa0Trump Organization\\'s negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow and made changes and additions. Cohen later pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about those negotiations, saying he did so to align with Trump\\'s preferred narrative. \"You said you lied to Congress about Trump\\'s negotiations to build his Moscow Tower because he made it clear to you that he wanted you to lie,\" Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said. \"One of the reasons you knew this was because \\'Mr. Trump\\'s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it.\\'\" \"So this is a pretty breathtaking claim and I just want to get to the facts here,\" Raskin continued. \"Which specific lawyers reviewed and edited your statement to Congress on the Moscow Tower negotiations and did they make any changes to your statement?\" \"There were changes made, additions,\" Cohen responded. \"Jay\\xa0Sekulow\\xa0for one.\" Cohen added that \"several changes\" were made, \"including how we were going to handle that message, which was — the message of course being the length of time that the Trump Tower Moscow project stayed and remained alive.\" Liz Johnstone Cohen made a brief statement to the assembled media on Capitol Hill after the hearing adjourned but did not take questions. \"Thank you all for being here today. I am humbled, I\\'m thankful to Chairman Cummings for giving me the opportunity today to tell my truth and I hope that as Chairman Cummings said, it helps in order to heal America,\" Cohen said. Get caught up on seven hours of testimony in three minutes by watching the video below. Dartunorro Clark In a heated closing statement, Chairman Cummings made a sweeping call for normalcy and protecting America\\'s democracy after a fiery hours-long hearing marked by partisan clashes and pointed attacks on Cohen\\'s credibility. “You made a lot of mistakes, Mr. Cohen, and you\\'ve admitted that. And you know what is the saddest part of this whole thing is? That some very innocent people are hurting too and you acknowledge that and that\\'s your family,” Cummings said. \"And you know if we as a nation did not give people an opportunity after they made mistakes to change their lives a whole lot of people would not do very well.\" He added, \"I want to say thank you. I know that this can be hard. I know that you are facing a lot.\\xa0I know that you are worried about your family but this is part of destiny and, hopefully, this portion of your destiny will lead to a better Micheal Cohen, a better Donald Trump, a better United States of America and a better world.\" He took a parting shot at Republican members of the committee who falsely claimed that this is the first hearing House Oversight has held since Democrats reclaimed the majority in the chamber. The first was one on prescription drug costs, he said, mentioning a person who died because she was unable to afford insulin. He noted his committee has also had hearings on a number of topics, including voting rights, before hearing from Cohen on Wednesday. \"We can do more than one thing,\" he said. \"And we have got to get back to normal.\"   Allan Smith Cohen delivered a brief but emotional statement at the end of his public testimony, in which he summed up his objections to the president and his fears for the future. \"I fear that if he loses the election in 2020, that there will never be a peaceful transition of power,\" he said of Trump. He then addressed the president directly, at times looking squarely into the TV cameras. \"We\\xa0honor our veterans — even in the rain,\" Cohen said referring to a trip to France where Trump opted against attending a World War 1 memorial event. \"You tell the truth, even when it doesn\\'t aggrandize you.\" \"You don\\'t attack the media and those who question what you don\\'t like or what you don\\'t want them to say and you take responsibility for your own dirty deeds. You don\\'t use your power of your bully pulpit to destroy the credibility of those who speak out against you. You don\\'t separate families from one another or demonize those looking to America for a better life. You don\\'t vilify people based on the god they pray to and you don\\'t cuddle up to our adversaries at the expense of our allies. Finally, you don\\'t shut down the government before Christmas and New Year\\'s just to simply appease your base. This behavior is churlish, it denigrates the office of the president and it\\'s simply un-American. And it\\'s not you,\" he said. \"So to those who support the president and his rhetoric as I once did, I pray the country doesn\\'t make the same mistakes that I have made or pay the heavy price that my family and I are paying.\" Cohen then thanked Chairman Cummings for his time. Dartunorro Clark Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., prompted a fiery exchange when she objected to the appearance of HUD official Lynne Patton in the audience earlier Wednesday. \"Just to make a note, Mr. Chairman, just because someone has a person of color, a black person working for them, doesn’t mean they aren\\'t racist. And it is insensitive that some would even say — the fact that someone would actually use a prop, a black woman, in this chamber, in this committee, is alone racist in itself,\" Tlaib said. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., who had invited Patton to stand as he defended Trump against Cohen\\'s charge that the president is a racist, erupted in anger, asking for the statement to be stricken from the record. \"I am not calling the gentleman, Mr. Meadows, a racist for doing so. I’m saying that in itself, it is a racist act,\" Tlaib responded. Meadows asked Chairman Elijah Cummings to vouch for him as not being racist. The pair noted that they have a close relationship. Tlaib ultimately apologized to Meadows, saying that she did not intend for him to feel that she was attacking him personally as a racist. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., also referred to Meadows\\' bringing Patton out to rebut allegations of racism against Trump. Allan Smith Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., pressed Cohen on whether Trump committed bank, tax and insurance fraud during brief questioning Wednesday afternoon. \"To your knowledge, did the president ever provide inflated assets to an insurance company?\" Ocasio-Cortez asked. \"Yes,\" Cohen replied. \"Who else knows that the president did this?\" Ocasio-Cortez responded. Cohen named several Trump Organization executives, including chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. \"Do you think we need to review financial statements and tax returns in order to compare them?\" Ocasio-Cortez asked. \"Yes,\" Cohen said. Ocasio-Cortez wrapped up her questioning under her allotted time. Allan Smith Cohen said that he didn\\'t actually think Trump\\'s tax returns were under audit during the 2016 election, contrary to what Trump has long claimed. \"I asked for a copy of the audit so that I could use it in terms of my statements to the press. And I was never able to obtain one,\" he said in answer to a question about whether Trump\\'s tax returns were, in fact, under audit by the IRS. Trump refused to release his tax returns while running for office because he said they were under audit. He has never released them. Trump is the only major party nominee of the past 40 years to not release his tax returns. Dareh Gregorian Cohen’s testimony may soon be coming to an end, but not his grilling. Cohen is planning to take questions from reporters after he’s done testifying under oath, according to his lawyer, Lanny Davis. Cohen is facing questions from several more lawmakers before ending his day of testimony. Stay tuned. ©\\xa02020 NBC UNIVERSAL': 1,\n",
       " 'February 26, 2019\\nBaxter Dmitry\\nNews, US\\n4 Two wealthy Ecuadorian brothers who were owners of companies fined and ordered to shut down for illegally trafficking world-wide in aborted baby parts purchased from Planned Parenthood, were arrested by ICE on February 13, 2019. Roberto and William Isaías, 74 and 75, were detained Wednesday in Miami, Florida and taken to a detention facility for undocumented immigrants awaiting deportation, The New York Times reported. ICE told the Times that the brothers were “unlawfully present” in the U.S. Roberto and William Isaias, who fled Ecuador to avoid 8-year prison sentences, were principals in California companies DaVinci Biosciences and DV Biologics, and the two career criminals were allowed to stay in the United States by Hillary Clinton’s State Department under “suspicious circumstances” after they donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign fund. According to Law.com: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested\\xa0Roberto and William Isaías on Feb. 13. ICE representative Nestor\\xa0Yglesias said the brothers were “unlawfully present” in the U.S., and have been “transferred to ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations” for deportation proceedings following their arrest. Yglesias\\xa0added\\xa0the pair is “in agency custody pending removal proceedings.” The arrest of Roberto and William Isaias was gratifying to Operation Rescue, which published an investigative research report on October 27, 2016 – just days before the Presidential Election that put Donald J. Trump in office – that detailed their crimes in Ecuador, dubious dealings with the Obama administration, their business with Planned Parenthood and the aborted baby body parts trade. “We understood that this family was in the U.S. under suspicious circumstances, and that they had committed crimes in Ecuador and Southern California,” said Operation Rescue President Troy Newman. “We had hoped that one day they would return to Ecuador so that justice could be done, but their arrests still took us by surprise.” LifeNews reports: In 2012, Roberto and William Isaias were sentenced in abstentia to eight years in prison for running their Ecuadorian bank into the ground then presenting false balance sheets to profit from bailout funds, wiping out the life savings of thousands of families.\\xa0 Ecuador says the Isaias family cost the impoverished country a total of $661.5 million. The Isaias family began dumping large amounts of campaign contributions into American political campaigns, including $90,000 to Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign. Career criminals protected by Hillary Clinton As a result, after reaching out to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for asylum, the Isaias’ were granted expedited immigration into the U.S.\\xa0 Clinton’s State Department then rebuffed attempts by Ecuador to extradite them to face justice. Once in America, the Isaias family owned and operated DaVinci Biosciences and DV Biologics, companies that contracted exclusively with Planned Parenthood of Orange County to receive aborted baby tissues and organs, which they trafficked overseas. Roberto and William Isaias’ nephew, Estafano Isaias, Jr., who was involved in profit-taking from the two biotech companies, also owned a business that sold pornography online.  After the release of the Center for Medical Progress’ undercover video exposés in 2015, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas sued the companies for their illegal body parts trade, and in 2017 reached a settlement agreement that fined them $7.8 million, and ordered their businesses to close. “We have mentioned the Isaias brothers repeatedly in articles that we have published over the past couple of years, including the corruption in the Obama Administration, which allowed them to come to our country where they committed further crimes,” said Newman.\\xa0 “We hoped that someone would take notice.” Just last month, Operation Rescue published an exposé that delved into the market for aborted baby body parts.\\xa0 It revealed that the DaVinci biotech companies sent tissues and organs obtained from Planned Parenthood around the world to businesses that were working to develop anti-aging drugs for the wealthy. “The Isaias’ are bad people, and we are very relieved that they will soon be back in Ecuador to serve their sentences and hopefully return the money they took from the people they bilked,” said Newman.\\xa0 “And we are especially glad that they are out of the baby parts trade permanently.” Playboy Model Who Had ‘Evidence of Elite Pedophile Ring’ Found Dead Philippine President Duterte Predicts Catholic Church Will Soon Disappear President Trump Says Adam Schiff Should Be Arrested For Treason Robert De Niro: Trump Is Possibly ‘Crazy’ In A ‘Medical Sense’ Rand Paul: Only Person Who Colluded With Russia Was Hillary Clinton Snopes Now Have Power To ‘Shadowban’ Conservative Facebook Users FBI: Peter Strzok Worked For The CIA Under Obama Suicide by Cop British ministry bids for deal with Saudi prison service Authorities Declined To Prosecute Biden’s Son For Cocaine Pipe Found in Rental Car Drinking while pregnant could become criminal offence in UK Israeli Forces Storm Hospital In Jerusalem German Minister Tells Police To Remove “Rape” From NYE Sex Attack Report Europe Vote To Drop Charges Against Snowden, Granting Him Asylum Dallas Ebola Nurse Amber Vinson: CDC ‘Said It Was OK’ To Fly After Thomas Duncan’s Death Shocker:  People concerned about FEMA camps, communism or Agenda 21 named ‘potential terrorists’ by U.S. government Nearly All Patient Advocacy Groups Funded By Big Pharma Jason Chaffetz: Andrew McCabe Should Be in Prison Greece May Introduce Brand New Currency Ahead Of EU Exit Video: Rescued Pilot Says Turkish Jets Gave No Warning Before Shooting School Has 5 Year Old Child Sign ‘Safety Contract’, For Pointing A Crayon Gun At Classmate California Labels Monsanto’s Roundup “Cancer Causing” Copyright © 2019 News Punch.

       " 'More than 1.5m people have been affected JOHANNESBURG AID WORKERS have described it as Mozambique’s worst humanitarian crisis since its 15-year civil war. Nearly a week after Tropical Cyclone Idai walloped the coast before churning inland, the full extent of the damage is still unclear. Beira, a port city of half a million people, was cut off after a storm hit between March 14th and 15th, bringing fierce winds and flooding that destroyed bridges, roads and electricity lines. Filipe Nyusi, the president, described seeing bodies floating in rivers as he flew over the region by helicopter. He said the death toll could rise to more than 1,000. Red Cross workers reckon 90% of buildings in Beira were damaged or destroyed and fear the situation may be worse still outside the city, where floodwaters have yet to recede. In some neighbourhoods, the tops of concrete-block houses were simply blown off. Elsewhere, video footage showed people huddled on rooftops, evoking memories of catastrophic floods in 2000, when the world was captivated by the story of a woman giving birth in a tree she had climbed to escape rising water. As the storm moved inland, it also swamped southern Malawi and eastern Zimbabwe. Chimanimani, in Zimbabwe, was especially badly hit; it was cut off because of damage to roads. Zimbabwe’s government said 98 people had died and more than 200 were missing. Torrential rains continue to deluge the region, adding to the misery. In all, more than 1.5m people have been affected. The UN has urgently appealed for donations. A long-term recovery plan will also be needed. The floods appear to have ruined maize crops, raising the risk of hunger. In Zimbabwe, where the government declared a disaster, a drought has already left 5.3m people in need of food aid. With the waters slow to recede, diseases may fester. Schools and hospitals along with bridges and roads need repair. Policymakers also need to prepare for the future. One challenge is improving warning systems. The Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre says that although there were good forecasts of the cyclone, the flooding and landslides it caused were less well anticipated. Low-lying coastal cities such as Beira are especially vulnerable to storms, which could worsen as climate change disrupts weather patterns. The destruction underlines the need to invest in protected infrastructure before the next assault.

       " 'A quiet revolutionary of economics died on March 16th FEW ECONOMISTS can claim either to have successfully challenged the bedrock beliefs of their field or to have altered how governments pursue policies that affect millions. Alan Krueger, who died on March 16th, managed both. In research with David Card in the early 1990s, Mr Krueger showed, through careful data analysis, that increases in the minimum wage did not lead to reductions in employment, as standard models suggested they should. The research, which the authors summarised in a seminal book, “Myth and Measurement”, published in 1995, drew a scathing initial response. Critics assaulted their motivations, data and analysis until allowing, finally, that the pair had a point. Their work changed economics and politics. It also exemplified Mr Krueger’s career as both scholar and public servant. Mr Krueger did not come across as the combative type. He was gracious and generous in person, and a skilled communicator. That came in handy during his time in Washington, as chief economist of the Department of Labour when Bill Clinton was president, and in the Treasury and the White House under Barack Obama during the most tumultuous economic times since the 1930s. He often wrote for the New York Times and appeared on television. Helping people understand what economists had learned was, he believed, part of an economist’s job. His passion, however, was the craft of economics. In 1987, as a newly minted PhD, Mr Krueger accepted a position at Princeton University, not far from the New Jersey town where he grew up. From the outset he was interested in understanding why workers earned what they did. But he recognised that the question could not be answered satisfactorily without rigorous and careful study of data. Mr Krueger subscribed to the New England Journal of Medicine, and admired the way each article began by discussing the paper’s research design. Economics badly lagged behind medicine and the physical sciences in the use of careful empirical work, not least because of the difficulty of running experiments on messy real-world interactions. In the late 1980s, however, some economists were honing methods to study “natural experiments”, in which a more or less random, localised event allowed researchers to compare the experiences of affected and unaffected groups, in something of the way that a laboratory scientist might compare treatment and control groups. Messrs Card and Krueger applied the approach to studying the effects of changes in the minimum wage. At the time most economists assumed that labour markets were more or less competitive. Workers could easily leave firms that offered them too little; firms had to accept prevailing market wages and would only hire as many workers as made financial sense. An increase in the minimum wage, by making labour more expensive, should thus translate directly into lower employment. But did it? Beginning in the early 1980s, increases in America’s national minimum wage were infrequent and too small to overcome the effects of inflation. Some states responded by raising their own minimum rates, creating just the natural experiment Messrs Card and Krueger needed. They studied the effect of a rise in New Jersey’s minimum wage in 1992 on employment in fast-food restaurants, using neighbouring Pennsylvania, which had not enacted an increase, as a comparator. They did not detect any negative effect on employment. Though arguments about this research rumbled on for years, its impact has been undeniable. It opened the floodgates to a wave of work with natural experiments. It also stirred debate about competition in labour markets, to which Mr Krueger would contribute for the rest of his life. Markets might not be very competitive at all, some economists reckoned, because it is costly for workers to find and switch jobs, or because large firms dominate markets or collude to suppress pay. In a talk last August, Mr Krueger cited a stream of recent research in arguing that stubbornly weak wage growth is strong evidence that workers have too little bargaining power, and that the economy is suffering as a result. It is wrong to label such dynamics “market imperfections”, he mused. As Mr Krueger pointed out, Adam Smith himself thought labour markets worked that way. Mr Krueger’s papers explored how factors from education to race to technology influenced workers’ prospects, often rustling up new data sources in the process. He drew a link between America’s opioid-addiction crisis and declining participation in the labour market, especially among men. He made a habit of attending a festival for twins with Orley Ashenfelter, a mentor and Princeton colleague, to seek subjects for studies of the influence of education on earnings, using genetic similarities to isolate the effect. Mr Krueger’s curiosity was insatiable. He published on a remarkable variety of topics. After the attacks of September 11th 2001, he explored the factors contributing to the decision to become a terrorist. In a book in 2007 he argued that political repression, rather than a dearth of economic opportunity, did most to foment terrorism. He studied the entertainment industry, to understand how technology and globalisation are affecting the economics of popular music (another passion): a book is due out in June. And, often in partnership with Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel laureate who pioneered the application of psychology to economics, Mr Krueger dug into the measurement of subjective well-being, hoping to find better ways of capturing shifts in what matters most in life (see article). The goal of economic progress is after all to help people lead more satisfying lives, and to foster its pursuit, governments and scholars need reliable data. It was a message he preached throughout his career. His professional example inspired scores of young scholars, whose work is a monument to his memory. Both economics and American public life are much poorer for his death.

       " 'But he clearly plans to keep pulling strings from behind the scenes ALMATY ONCE A STRONGMAN has been in power for 30 years, it is reasonable to assume he will leave office only in a coup or a coffin. But Nursultan Nazarbayev, the 78-year-old who has run Kazakhstan since 1989, is trying to find a third way. On March 19th he took to the airwaves to announce his retirement as president of the oil-rich Central Asian country. The announcement marks the end of an era, not just for Kazakhstan but for the region: Mr Nazarbayev was its last Soviet-era leader left in power. When the former steelworker ascended to the leadership, Kazakhstan was still part of the Soviet Union. He presided over independence in 1991 and had governed ever since. A showman to the last, Mr Nazarbayev signed his resignation decree on live television. On March 20th Kassym-Zhomart Tokayev, the 65-year-old chairman of the Senate, was sworn in for the rest of Mr Nazarbayev’s term, as the constitution stipulates. Mr Tokayev immediately ordered Astana, the vainglorious capital Mr Nazarbayev founded, rechristened “Nursultan” in his honour. Shymkent, Kazakhstan’s third-largest city, rushed to rename its main street “Nazarbayev”. Rumours had long swirled that Mr Nazarbayev was preparing to step down. Yet his physical and mental health seem robust; there had been no inkling the announcement was coming this week. Fully half of Kazakhstan’s 18m citizens have never known any other leader. Mr Nazarbayev said that it was time to hand power to a younger generation. But his retirement is less a graceful bowing-out than a manoeuvre designed to allow him to micromanage the transition to a new leader, just as he has micromanaged every other aspect of Kazakh politics for so many years. Mr Nazarbayev has a special legal status that grants him considerable post-retirement powers. The Leader of the Nation (his official title) will still chair the Security Council, which gives him direct sway over the armed forces. He also enjoys the right to intervene in policymaking for the rest of his life. He is immune from prosecution for actions committed in office. His and his family’s assets cannot be seized. His eldest daughter, Dariga Nazarbayeva, replaced Mr Tokayev as chairman of the Senate, placing her next in line to the presidency. By securing Kazakhstan’s independence, Mr Nazarbayev literally put it on the map, as he pointed out in his resignation speech. He has kept it there by maintaining cordial ties with his giant neighbours, Russia and China, as well as with America. Mr Nazarbayev also expressed pride at the relative harmony among the more-than-100 ethnic groups in Kazakhstan. He took credit, too, for dragging the country out of the economic stagnation of the post-Soviet period into petrodollar-fuelled prosperity, although he failed to mention that his cronies have benefited more than his people. Mr Nazarbayev’s most brazen claim was that he had built a democracy, despite presiding over three decades of rigged elections, jailed critics and muzzled media. Elections are due to be held at the end of next year, although an early vote is not ruled out. Mr Nazarbayev did not name a preferred candidate, but it seems inconceivable that he does not have one in mind. That could be Mr Tokayev or another, younger lieutenant, such as Askar Mamin, 53, who was promoted to prime minister in a recent cabinet reshuffle. If he intends his daughter to become president, he has been careful not to signal it openly. The new president will certainly not emerge from the ranks of the opposition, since Mr Nazarbayev has hounded it out of existence. His preferred successor will almost certainly saunter into office after a rubberstamp election—although perhaps not with the 98% of the vote that Mr Nazarbayev is supposed to have won last time. Presumably, Mr Nazarbayev does not intend a big political opening, or he would have started one while still in office himself. As he reassured his people when announcing his momentous decision: “I will be staying with you.” This article appeared in the Asia section of the print edition under the headline \"Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan’s strongman, resigns\" Sign up to our free daily newsletter, The Economist today Published since September 1843 to take part in “a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.” Copyright © The Economist Newspaper Limited 2020.

       " 'President Donald Trump vetoes a law to end America’s role in the Yemen war WERE THE founding fathers to return, suggested Michael Beschloss, a historian, in last year’s “Presidents of War”, they would be “thunderstruck” to discover how the power to kick off major wars could now “rest on the whim of a President”. Presidents have “regularly told Congress to go to hell” on such matters, as Harry Truman admiringly noted of his predecessor, James Polk. Donald Trump is keeping up that tradition. On April 16th he wielded his veto for only the second time in his presidency to strike down a groundbreaking law that might have forced him to end America’s support for the Saudi-led war against the Houthi militia in Yemen. The fighting has caused what the UN calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. That the bill got so far, so quickly, is notable in itself. It sped through Congress—passing even the Republican-controlled the Senate on 13th March and the House on 4th April—because of expedited procedures, never before used, granted by the War Powers Resolution (WPR). This act was passed in 1973 in response to Richard Nixon’s secretive expansion of the Vietnam war. In theory, the WPR tied presidents’ hands by requiring them first to consult Congress before sending forces abroad, and then to ask Congress for a declaration of war or a specific mandate to keep them there beyond 60 days. In practice, most presidents have either stretched or ignored the law. Much of the recent stretching has occurred as a result of America’s sprawling “war on terror”. Three days after the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001, Congress passed an Authorisation for Use of Military Force (AUMF) permitting George Bush to go after those who “planned, authorised, committed or aided” the atrocity. That was clearly a reference to al-Qaeda, then holed up in Afghanistan. But by 2016 the AUMF had been used by Mr Bush and his successor, Barack Obama, 37 times to justify action in 14 countries—“even against groups that did not exist on 9/11”, points out Christopher Anders of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Mr Obama, for instance, deployed the AUMF in defence of his war on Islamic State in Iraq and Syria even though the group angrily split from al-Qaeda long ago. However, the WPR was gutted long before the elastic AUMF created loopholes wide enough to fly F-16s through. Most presidents after Nixon have simply ignored it, declaring its demands to be an unconstitutional infringement on their executive powers. Some presidents have tried to conjure up a mandate in dubious ways. When the Kosovo war crossed the 60-day mark in 1999, Bill Clinton insisted that Congress had expressed approval by ponying up money for it—never mind that the WPR explicitly says that does not count, and that lawmakers are loth to cut off funds for troops in the line of fire. The most inventive approach has been to pretend that, contrary to appearances, there is in fact no war. In 2011 Mr Obama said he was free to bomb Libya because the action was led by NATO, did not involve “sustained fighting or active exchanges of fire” and was unlikely to escalate—and so did not meet the definition of “hostilities” envisaged by the WPR. Mr Trump has put forward much the same argument for his own entanglement in Yemen (which started under Mr Obama). Indeed had he signed the Yemen bill rather than nixing it, it is likely that his administration would have claimed its provisions did not apply to Yemen anyway. Lawmakers are right to roll their eyes at such make-believe. After all, American commanders sit in an operations room in Riyadh next to their Saudi counterparts. American engineers service the Saudi warplanes taking off to drop bombs. Until recently American planes refuelled the Saudi bombers mid-flight. War at arms-length is still war. Meanwhile the fighting has left ten million Yemenis “one step away from famine”, warned the UN’s World Food Programme. Congress, though exasperated, does not have the numbers to override Mr Trump’s veto. But it is likely to continue the fight in other ways, such as by tacking riders onto the annual National Defence Authorisation Act, which is much trickier for the president to quash. At least some of the founding fathers would have approved.

Cohen, President Trump\\'s former lawyer, testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, and although it wasn\\'t open to the public, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) told CNN that Cohen spent \"quite a bit of time explaining what he had told us before that wasn\\'t truthful\" This would presumably include Cohen telling the Senate Intelligence Committee in a 2017 letter that discussions of building a Trump Tower in Moscow ended in January 2016. Cohen would later plead guilty to lying to Congress, admitting that the discussions continued for months afterward and that he lied about the timeline in order to fit with Trump\\'s \"political messaging.\" CNN reports Cohen was asked why he lied and whether Trump was involved, although there\\'s no word on what he told them. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told CNN that Cohen was receiving an \"extensive grilling\" by the committee. She also said the testimony was surprising because \"he\\'s a very different guy\" now. Cohen on Wednesday will testify again, but this time in public and before the House Oversight Committee. He will reportedly for the first time publicly accuse Trump of criminal activity while in office, also bringing documents with him and discussing Trump\\'s alleged \"lies, racism, and cheating.\" Republicans have dismissed Cohen\\'s testimony as meaningless since he has lied to Congress in the past. \"It\\'s laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word,\" the White House said Tuesday, \"and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies.\" Brendan Morrow RNC chair refuses to criticize or defend her uncle Mitt Romney after he was barred from conservative conference There will be no family feuding here, at least on television. Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel mostly deflected questions from CBS\\' Margaret Brennan about her uncle Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) during a Face the Nation appearance Sunday. The Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday announced Romney won\\'t be invited to this year\\'s event after he broke with Republicans and voted for additional witnesses in President Trump\\'s impeachment trial. Brennan wanted to know what McDaniel thought about that, as well as CPAC\\'s intense ad which made it very clear Romney wasn\\'t invited. Brennan also tried to guage McDaniel\\'s reaction to the argument that Trump has altered the Republican Party, leaving more traditional GOP names like Romney out in the wilderness. But McDaniel evaded talking about her uncle directly and instead praised Trump for representing real Republican ideals, while dismissing the notion the party had morphed. She didn\\'t defend Romney, either. McDaniel said she gets why CPAC and other party members are upset at Republicans who don\\'t always support the president because they view going against the grain as contributing to the election of a Democratic president in 2020.

But the sidelines offer their own intrigue. Sunday offers a chance at redemption for Kansas City head coach Andy Reid and his counterpart in San Francisco, Kyle Shanahan. It\\'s harsh to suggest Shanahan has Super Bowl demons he needs to get rid of. This is just his third year as a head coach and he\\'s only 40-years-old, so it looks like he\\'ll be coaching for a long time. But he still likely has a sour taste in his mouth from 2017 when he was the offensive coordinator for the Atlanta Falcons and watched his offense sputter in the second half as Atlanta blew a 28-3 lead against the New England Patriots. Shanahan\\'s normally revered play-calling — fairly or unfairly — received some of the blame for the collapse in the immediate aftermath. He\\'s got an opportunity to shed that part of his growing legacy. Long considered one of the great offensive minds in the game, Reid puts competitive teams together year in and year out, but he\\'s dealt with as much postseason heartbreak as any coach in the modern era. From 2001 to 2003, his Philadelphia Eagles lost three straight NFC title games, before finally breaking through in 2004, only to lose the Super Bowl against, you guessed it, the Patriots. The well-loved Reid gets a lot of props for his play-calling, but his late-game decision-making is often the source of ridicule, particularly his clock management in the postseason. He doesn\\'t have to worry about that as much these days thanks to playmakers like quarterback Patrick Mahomes, tight end Travis Kelce, and wide receiver Tyreek Hill. If that group can pull it off, Reid\\'s Hall of Fame chances will start to look like a lock.

       " 'Why Boeing will likely cruise through its crisis Boeing\\'s 737 Max 8 has been grounded. On Wednesday, the United States finally banned flights of the aircraft, following the same decision by 42 other countries. The Max 8 was Boeing\\'s best selling aircraft ever, but one of the planes crashed on Sunday, and another crashed back in October. Both disasters may be linked to the same glitch. You\\'d think this could be an existential threat to the aircraft manufacturer. There are 4,600 outstanding orders for the Max 8 around the world — $550 billion in expected future revenue. Max 8 sales this year were projected to be almost a third of Boeing\\'s annual revenue. Not surprisingly, the company\\'s stock is down about 11 percent. But in truth, Boeing will probably cruise through this episode unscathed. Analyses of the crashes are ongoing. But in the October crash, it looks like a particular autopilot function, relying on a single sensor, miscalculated and pitched the plane into an unexpected dive. Pilots across the world — including the U.S. — have been complaining about this glitch for a while. And there\\'s circumstantial evidence the same thing happened in Sunday\\'s crash. Since the October crash, Boeing has been working on a software update to fix the problem: Have the autopilot function rely on input from multiple sensors, along with changes to \"flight control law, pilot displays, operation manuals, and crew training.\" The fix was originally due in January, but was delayed by \"differences of opinion about technical and engineering issues,\" between Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as well as by the recent government shutdown, The Wall Street Journal reports. In the interim, Boeing issued some new guidance to pilots. And \"the FAA concluded the delay was acceptable because its experts agreed with Boeing that there was no imminent safety threat,\" according to one of the Journal\\'s sources. U.S. regulators now want the fix finished by the end of April, though new information gleaned from Sunday\\'s crash could extend the timeline. Now, that\\'s not the most encouraging chain of events. But the gist is that all of the Max 8s currently in service, as well as all the aircraft on order, can be fixed. Barring something truly unforeseen, the grounding will almost certainly be temporary — a few months, give or take. Analysts told The New York Times that fixing the software problem could cost Boeing $1 billion. Then there are the 350 aircraft already out there, and airlines aren\\'t inclined to just eat the costs of keeping those Max 8s on the ground. \"We will send this bill to those who produce this aircraft,\" Bjorn Kjos, the CEO of Norwegian Air, told the Times. Leasing a replacement jet for three months likely costs $1 million a pop, so multiply that by 350 and add it to Boeing\\'s price tag, too. Another estimate for The Washington Post put the worst-case scenario at a $5.1 billion hit to Boeing over two months. But those numbers also have to be put in context. Boeing\\'s total revenue for 2018 was just over $100 billion and its total profits were just over $10 billion. You could double that worst-case scenario estimate, and you\\'d merely knock out Boeing\\'s profits for 2019. And that hit won\\'t continue year after year. For a company like Boeing, profits are gravy: They come after all operating costs, including wages and salaries and taxes, have already been paid. The only thing they fund are shareholder payouts. That could certainly affect the company\\'s stock. But a lower stock price has little effect on Boeing proper — it mostly hurts Wall Street traders. Simply put, even the worst-worst-case scenario would barely make a dent in Boeing\\'s bottom line. And those huge revenue streams also mean Boeing could almost certainly weather any lawsuits over the crisis. Finally, assuming Boeing does fix the issue in the next few months, it\\'s unlikely that customers will wiggle out of those 4,600 orders. Airlines usually pay 20 percent of the orders upfront, and getting out of those contracts is not easy. Beyond that, Boeing enjoys a near monopoly status in this instance: The Max 8\\'s only real market competitor is the A320neo, from the European manufacturer Airbus, and there\\'s already a multi-year backlog of orders for that plane. If Boeing can make a reasonable case that it\\'s repaired the glitch, customers will find that dropping their orders will be more trouble than it\\'s worth. \"I don\\'t think anyone will abandon them,\" Jonathan G. Ornstein, the CEO of Mesa Airlines, told the Times. The big unknown here is damage to Boeing\\'s reputation. I\\'ve just given a pretty technical and bloodless assessment of Boeing\\'s business chances. But 346 people are dead quite likely because Boeing screwed up. Reputational damage is an inherently unpredictable and unquantifiable thing. But given everything laid out above, there are many structural barriers that reputational damage would have to overcome to seriously threaten the company. In fact, this isn\\'t even the first time a screw-up has grounded Boeing\\'s planes recently. Batteries randomly catching fire temporarily grounded the company\\'s Dreamliner in 2013, but Boeing suffered no noticeable long-term damage as a result. This crisis is obviously much worse. But the fact is, due to Boeing\\'s sheer size and reach, it will most likely be consigned to the history books as well. Whether you think that\\'s a good thing is another matter entirely.

In his veto message, Trump wrote that the measure is an \"unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future.\" The coalition is fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, who want to take control of the Yemeni government. The Trump administration has said it must support Saudi Arabia in order to keep Iranian influence from spreading. The war has caused a humanitarian crisis, with thousands of civilians dying from illness and starvation. This is the second veto of Trump\\'s presidency. First death resulting from Coronavirus outside China reported Chiefs, 49ers set for Super Bowl clash Key Iowa poll cancels result reveal before caucuses At least 20 killed in Church service stampede in Tanzania Djokovic wins Australian Open First death resulting from Coronavirus outside China reported The Philippines reported the first death resulting from the Wuhan coronavirus outside of China on Sunday. A 44-year-old man who tested positive for the new coronavirus died Saturday in the Philippines after developing what officials called \"severe pneumonia.\" He was reportedly in stable condition until the final 24 hours. The patient was a native of Wuhan, China, where the virus appears to have originated. He arrived in the Philippines in January with a 38-year-old woman who also tested positive for the coronavirus and remains isolated in a hospital in Manila. In China, officials reported Sunday that the country\\'s death toll rose to at least 304 people, and the worldwide total of confirmed cases — the vast majority within China — has reached nearly 14,380, per Chinese and World Health Organization data. Chiefs, 49ers set for Super Bowl clash Super Bowl LIV will kick off at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, Florida, at 6:30 p.m. E.T. on Fox. The NFC champion San Francisco 49ers will take on their AFC counterpart, the Kansas City Chiefs, in what is expected to be a highly entertaining game. San Francisco finished 13-3 on the year and cruised in their two playoff games. Led by coach Kyle Shanahan, a dominant run game, and stalwart defense, the Niners are considered one of the league\\'s most complete teams. Kansas City, meanwhile, finished 12-4 and has an electric offense featuring one of the game\\'s most talented players in quarterback Patrick Mahomes. In other football news, five players — Troy Polamalu, Edgerrin James, Steve Atwater, Isaac Bruce, and Steve Hutchinson — were elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday. Key Iowa poll cancels result reveal before caucuses With the Iowa caucuses swiftly approaching, the state\\'s most highly regarded poll from CNN and The Des Moines Register was canceled Saturday. CNN decided to pull the plug on the highly anticipated survey in the lead up to Monday\\'s caucuses after campaign aides to former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg raised concerns about how interviews were conducted. Buttigieg\\'s name was reportedly left out of an interview, and it was unclear if other candidates were similarly omitted, a source familiar with the situation said. The Buttigieg campaign applauded CNN and the Register \"for their integrity\" after deciding against releasing the results of the poll, which have traditionally given leading candidates a momentum boost going into the caucuses. At least 20 killed in Church service stampede in Tanzania At least 20 people were killed and 16 others injured during a Pentacostal service at a stadium led by a popular preacher in the town of Moshi, Tanzania, on Saturday evening. Kippi Warioba, Moshi\\'s district commissioner, said the casualties were a result of a stampede after attendees rushed forward to be anointed by oil the preacher, Boniface Mwamposa, poured on the ground. Witnesses said people were hoping to be cured of sickness. Police said Mwamposa was being held for questioning, and authorities are still looking into the possibility of more casualties because there were so many people at the service. Djokovic wins Australian Open Novak Djokovic captured his 17th Grand Slam title after rallying Sunday to defeat Dominic Thiem in the Australian Open\\'s men\\'s singles finals at Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne. Djokovic was down two sets to one and at one point lost six straight games to Thiem, but he settled down and secured the victory in five sets, 6-4, 4-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4. It\\'s the 32-year-old Serbian\\'s eighth Australian Open crown and his second in a row. With the win, Djokovic inches closer to Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, who have 20 and 19 Grand Slam titles, respectively, and are both older than their on-court rival. Djokovic will also reportedly supplant Nadal as the world\\'s no. 1 men\\'s player as a result of the Melbourne win. The 26-year-old Austrian Thiem has now appeared in three major titles, but has yet to get his hands on a trophy.

       " 'Bernie\\'s a millionaire now. It doesn\\'t matter. After some delays, Bernie Sanders has released 10 years of tax returns. It turns out he is pretty rich. He took in $561,293 in adjusted gross income in 2018 — but over a million dollars in both 2017 and 2016, when he had a ton of book revenue coming in. That makes him the third-highest earning Democratic candidate this year, behind Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren. Indeed, Sanders is officially in the top 1 percent of income, and this has some wondering if it somehow jams up his political narrative. His \"higher income in recent years has created some political awkwardness for the senator, who in his 2016 presidential campaign frequently railed against \\'millionaires and billionaires\\' and their influence over the political process,\" writes Thomas Kaplan in The New York Times. This is nonsense. The only reason to worry about a candidate\\'s income is insofar as it suggests they are either vulnerable to corruption, or have been corrupted. Sanders has made a lot of money, but he is certainly not on the take — and he will not hesitate to raise his own taxes if he gets a chance. The obvious truth as to why Sanders is rich is that he is very famous, and it is extremely easy to capitalize on fame. All he had to do was write a book — or even easier, pay someone else to do it, though reportedly Sanders did not use a ghostwriter. He probably could have gotten a lot more if he had been strategic about it. Just look how Kim Kardashian makes more money than her husband Kanye West. What matters here is the method by which politicians and ex-politicians capitalize on that fame. For instance, the usual buckraking speech tour of big Wall Street banks that ex-politicians routinely carry out is objectionable because of corruption. Do bankers really care about hearing some probably platitudinous 40-minute speech? No, they are paying for access to potential future senators and presidents, and to create the reward pathway of banker-friendly politicos getting plausibly-deniable bribes if they govern the way bankers want. Leftists and even liberals like Matt Yglesias argued that Barack Obama should not have taken a $400,000 fee to speak at the bond firm Cantor Fitzgerald because it undermines the legitimacy of his (incredibly banker-friendly) bailout record. \"Did you really avoid breaking up the big banks because you thought it would undermine financial stability, or were you on the take?\" writes Yglesias. But nobody cared about the much larger $65 million book advance Obama got, because there isn\\'t some Big Reader lobby that is pushing for book subsidies or something. And unlike President Trump, Sanders doesn\\'t have some vast business empire. On the contrary, even with his book money he is still towards the bottom of the congressional net worth rankings, with wealth of about $1 million — a tiny fraction of Rep. Greg Gianforte\\'s (R-Mont.) $136 million or Rep. Jared Polis\\' (D-Colo.) $122 million. Nor is there any suggestion that Sanders would moderate his anti-plutocratic politics to benefit him personally. On the contrary, he promised to raise his taxes sharply in the statement accompanying the release of his returns: \"I will continue to fight to make our tax system more progressive so that our country has the resources to guarantee the American Dream to all people.\" Indeed, Sanders would no doubt love to have had much higher taxes in the past so as to keep his wealth from getting even that high. As James Adomian\\'s Sanders parody character put it in a video about him scrambling to finish his tax return: \"They are not taxing me at a high enough rate. Jane, is there any way we can pay an alternative maximum tax?\" It would be wise for Sanders to make these points explicitly. So far he has been (as usual) a little prickly about his money, saying \"I didn\\'t know it was a crime to write a good book.\" A little jaunty humor about soaking himself to pay for Medicare-for-all would go a long way. Still, there is something peculiar in the notion that only personally impoverished people can hold leftist views — as if one can\\'t be a critic of capitalism and own an iPhone. The effect is to foreclose any realistic leftist politics, since poor people have zero political power — and as we have seen, anyone who becomes a national figure becomes rich almost automatically. Of course, wealth often does influence someone\\'s views, but it\\'s not determinative — the most egalitarian president in American history, Franklin Roosevelt, was a scion of extreme wealth and privilege, far richer than Sanders will ever be. So one might fault Sanders for not donating that much to charity — though that is no substitute for a proper welfare state. But there is no reason to question his (or Elizabeth Warren\\'s, for that matter) egalitarian political commitments.

       " 'Bernie\\'s clear lane to the Democratic nomination On Monday afternoon Bernie Sanders showed us how he could win the Democratic nomination. Appearing at a pseudo-town hall event on Fox News, Sanders argued in favor of Medicare-for-all, increasing taxes on the wealthy, and remaking America\\'s relationship with Saudi Arabia. Perhaps most important of all, he insisted that Democrats must do more than simply run against President Trump in 2020. He sounded smart, concise, and polished in a way that he rarely has, and managed to do so despite a hostile and occasionally moronic line of questioning — e.g., the usual \"If you love taxes so much, why don\\'t you marry them?\" shtick. Sanders\\'s willingness to go into the lions\\' den shows that he already sees himself not as someone contending for the nomination of his party but rather as a de facto nominee pitching his ideas to the wider American public. This confidence puts him in a rhetorically advantageous position. The Democratic National Committee\\'s announcement in March that Fox News would not be allowed to host any debates with its candidates was cowardly. (It also side-stepped the fact that no network\\'s talent tried harder to hold Trump to account during the last cycle of debates than Fox News\\' Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace.) Sanders understands that he has nothing to lose and everything to gain by appearing in front of right-leaning audiences. On a channel where the top opinion program is hosted by Tucker Carlson, who has spoken positively about single-payer health care and criticized the financialization of the American economy, why shouldn\\'t Democrats expect to reach people? Because only one of them is Bernie. This is the key to his appeal and the path he will try to take toward the nomination in 2020. If 2016 showed us anything it is that in an overly crowded primary field one candidate who is able to distinguish himself clearly and immediately from the competition can win primaries. This will not be because he starts with the support of an overwhelming majority — much the opposite. But all Sanders needs is what Trump had last time, which is to say, a plurality of 25 or 30 percent. When you add up their 1 or 2 or 5 percent each, the other dozen or so candidates have more voters between them, but it counts for absolutely nothing. There is one likely obstacle for Sanders and his outsider-plurality strategy going forward. This is the possibility that Democrats will line up behind a single establishment candidate whose chief virtue for many is that simply that he or she is not Sanders. This is what Republicans failed to do in 2016 when Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and John Kasich each in turn presented himself as the healthy consensus choice only to find themselves rejected by the party\\'s base. The most obvious person to fill this role in 2020 is, of course, Joe Biden, who has not even announced his candidacy yet. His attempt to apologize without apologizing for his handsy antics will please older voters, but it is unlikely to persuade the crucial but poorly understood bloc of younger Democrats who are socially liberal and fiscally moderate without explicitly acknowledging the latter — what I think of as the Refinery29 vote. Biden may not be an old white man with some icky misogynistic supporters like Sanders, but he still has too much baggage. There will always be as many arguments against him as there are for him, just as there were always enough reasons on hand for GOP primary voters to convince themselves not to get behind Jeb and Little Marco in 2016. Sanders\\'s political future is not assured. In addition to defining himself against the competition, he will require a certain amount of luck. The longer his fellow candidates remain in the race, the more successful his strategy is likely to be. The other lesson of the last election is one that he will probably remember — namely, that a radical outsider stands less of a chance running against one serious establishment candidate. Against the alphabet soup of O\\'RourkeWarrenButtigiegBookerKlobucharCastroYangGillibrandDelaneyGabbard he is Bernie.

       " 'Buttigieg\\'s bid to reboot Obamaism The biggest surprise of the absurdly early contest for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination is undeniably the meteoric rise of Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year old gay-married mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who officially announced his candidacy at an event on Sunday afternoon. In a new Emerson poll released Monday morning, Buttigieg came in third with 9 percent. That\\'s far behind the frontrunners Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, with 29 and 24 percent respectively. But it beats a series of candidates with much greater name recognition, much longer track records, and much more prominent perches, including no fewer than five senators — Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, and Kirsten Gillibrand. Buttigieg even edges Beto O\\'Rourke, the former House member from El Paso, Texas, who challenged and narrowly lost a Senate bid to Ted Cruz last November. When O\\'Rourke announced his own candidacy in mid-March, analysts predicted he might surge to the head of the pack on a wave of mainstream excitement and anticipation. Here, it seemed, was a possible successor to Barack Obama — a young, charismatic candidate who could catalyze a movement fueled by a feel-good desire for hope and change from the Trump era, just as Obama had done after eight years of George W. Bush. That impression was bolstered by the fact that several prominent members of the old Obama team swooned early on for Beto, making clear that they saw him as someone who could pick up the mantle from the 44th president, building and perhaps expanding on his enduring popularity. Yet O\\'Rourke has hit the ground with a bit of a thud. Yes, he has enthusiasm and energy. But he isn\\'t catching fire, at least not yet — and at least not in the way that Buttigieg appears to be doing. Unlike Beto, no one was clamoring for \"Mayor Pete\" to jump into the race. He did it all on his own — creating a considerable splash at a CNN Town Hall in early March and then agreeing to a flood of interviews that kept his face, biography, accomplishments, and distinctive way of talking about politics close to the center of the action for the past month. The result is that he now leads the second tier of candidates — and could well surpass Beto in the contest to reboot Obamaism. Journalists, activists, pundits, intellectuals — all of them, myself very much included, think that political campaigns should focus on policy. It\\'s what those who care about ideas think is important. It\\'s what establishes a candidate\\'s seriousness, and what reveals his or her agenda — what the candidate wants to do with political power. That\\'s why so many of us who lean left swoon for Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both of whom lead with very specific and ambitious policy proposals. But Buttigieg understands what countless polls have verified, which is that most voters pay little attention to politics, and that even those who devote some time to it tend not to focus on policy specifics. Instead, these relatively low-information voters get carried along by a story — a story of a candidate and the story that candidate tells about America. That\\'s where Buttigieg is excelling, just as Obama did before him. What kind of stories do rank-and-file Democrats like to hear? Stories with a happy ending. And what\\'s a happier ending than a candidate from a once-persecuted group triumphing over adversity to run for and possibly win the highest office in the land? That was Obama\\'s story, and it\\'s Buttigieg\\'s, too, right down to the kiss he shared with his husband right after announcing his candidacy for the presidency. This is the sunny side of the multicultural identity politics that defines the Democratic Party more thoroughly with each electoral cycle. The darker side of the same trend can be seen when each group attempts to elbow past the others, battling over who\\'s the bigger victim of straight, white, male oppression, while failing to offer a compelling and hopeful vision of the country\\'s future. The Obamaian approach has the distinctive political advantage of acknowledging obstacles to equality and justice while also demonstrating that progress continues — that underneath or alongside the ugliness of the Trump era, there can be hope for better days. Paired with that love of overcoming adversity is the thrill of the party\\'s standard-bearer positioning himself as Beyond Politics. Obama was a master of this, even when (especially in his first term) it left him ill-equipped to defend himself and his party against a Republican Party hellbent on absolute opposition. Buttigieg shows signs of mastering it, too, as when he speaks about Trump voters in terms of understanding and sympathy, suggesting it\\'s \"not accidental that some areas that have seen the most disruption in our social and economic life are those that are most likely to produce a lot of domestic extremists.\" The Democratic love of presidential candidates who position themselves at least partially above the partisan fray is an expression of what the polls tell us. Whereas the Republican Party has a large base of ideological conservatives who consistently work to pull the GOP to the right, the Democratic base includes a great deal more self-described moderates. Those voters might not be centrists in ideological terms. But they long to be more than a faction. They want to speak for the country as a whole, to be unifiers. They resist the base-mobilization strategy that has been working for the Republicans. They don\\'t just want to galvanize grassroots activists and win by manipulating America\\'s counter-majoritarian institutions. The Democrats crave legitimacy. They want to be loved by as many people as possible, and they believe in their hearts that those supporters can and should include all people of good will. What this boils down to is a question of style and, even more so, communication. The assumption is that the Democrats have a core set of moral and policy priorities that the party\\'s nominee doesn\\'t have to list and discuss in detail on the stump. Instead, he or she should stand for ideals, values, a vision. The Democratic nominee should be as broadly appealing as possible, an exemplar of the \"better angels of our nature\" as Americans. Feel good about him or her, and we\\'ll feel good about ourselves — and vice versa. In his recent hit job on Buttigieg from the left in Current Affairs, Nathan Robinson laceratingly parodies how this thinking sounds to someone devoted to pushing a more factional and policy-specific candidacy: \"He\\'s from the Rust Belt so he\\'s authentic, but he went to Harvard so he\\'s not a rube, but he\\'s from a small city so he\\'s relatable, but he\\'s gay so he\\'s got coastal appeal, but he\\'s a veteran so his sexuality won\\'t alienate rural people.\" Put in a less sneering tone, one might say that Buttigieg hopes to be many things to many kinds of people. Just as Obama was a professorial community organizer with a white Christian mother and a black Muslim father who lived abroad as a boy, admired the mainline Protestant Reinhold Niebuhr, and worshipped in a church run by a pastor who preached black liberation theology. Like Walt Whitman — and like America itself — Obama contained multitudes. And so does the multilingual gay veteran from blue-collar Indiana.

       " 'Everyone is going to be disappointed by the Mueller report On Thursday, almost two years after the special counsel investigation headed by Robert Mueller was launched, the Department of Justice will publish Mueller\\'s much-anticipated report — with redactions, of course, to protect classified material and raw grand-jury testimony. The report\\'s publication promises an end to some of the divisions that engulfed the first half of Donald Trump\\'s term as president and dominated the midterm elections. At least, it promises an eventual end to them. At least for a few days, both parties will attempt to keep the fight alive by pumping hot takes into snippets of the report, hoping to salvage their own preferred narratives from the findings of the investigation. Does the report confirm that Mueller found enough malfeasance to impeach Trump? Does the report support Trump\\'s total exoneration and make the original FBI counterintelligence probe look like a \"witch hunt\"? Of course! It will do both at the same time, or so we will hear. Unfortunately for partisans, the report will likely disappoint both sides, and will bore everyone else. Both sides have hyped up the investigation to the point that Mueller\\'s report can\\'t possibly compete with the narratives. Let\\'s consider the Democrats\\' narratives first. For two years, members of the party\\'s leadership have repeatedly assured voters that they have seen the evidence for collusion with their own eyes. As late as last week, House Intelligence Committee chair Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) still insisted that evidence of collusion existed, regardless of what Attorney General William Barr wrote in his summary. After Barr published his letter, Democrats doubled down on those allegations by adding accusations that Barr was covering up for his boss. House Judiciary chair Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) has threatened to subpoena Mueller\\'s full report without redactions, a move that would conflict with the law regarding grand jury testimony. But if Democrats hope that Thursday\\'s release of the redacted report will corroborate those allegations, they\\'re almost certainly in for another round of disillusion and reduced credibility. A member of Mueller\\'s team has worked with Barr and outgoing deputy AG Rod Rosenstein to properly redact the report. Both Mueller and Rosenstein have been targets of Trump\\'s wrath and have been the subjects of Democratic bills to protect them from being fired by the president. Neither has publicly complained about Barr\\'s letter or the redaction process, which both could have done easily any time after Barr released his summary. In fact, Rosenstein went out of his way to endorse both last week in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. \"He\\'s being as forthcoming as he can,\" Rosenstein said of Barr, and so this notion that he\\'s trying to mislead people, I think is just completely bizarre.\" All Barr intended with the summary letter, Rosenstein explained, was to give the \"top-line conclusions\" in as timely a manner as possible. If that\\'s the case, and the broad strokes of Barr\\'s letter are confirmed by the full report, then Democrats will still be left with an investigation that found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. That will expose their previous claims that collusion had already been established as entirely false and may alone be enough to take the wind out of the sails of investigations started by Schiff and Nadler. Even if they find questionable actions and discussions within the Mueller report, their earlier hyperbole raised expectations so high that anything less will be dismissed as hardly worth the bother. Oddly enough, Trump and Republicans face a similar problem. Trump has spent the last two years calling the investigation a \"witch hunt.\" The White House and many Republicans seized on the Barr letter to claim total exoneration for Trump. In that sense, the Barr letter almost certainly represents the high point of the probe for Trump and the GOP. Shorn of the details of the investigation, the conclusions play very well for the president, with the only small downside being Mueller\\'s odd decision to not make a decision on obstruction of justice. It\\'s that choice that now stands to face the most intense scrutiny, and it seems likely the investigative report will have a pro-con list of actions and declarations that could arguably have justified charging the president. Even with the grand jury testimony redacted, Mueller\\'s investigative report may include a lot of details on Trump campaign activities that may not rise to the level of criminality but were far less than virtuous. That risk could also exist in the White House itself. NBC News heard from several unnamed administration officials who have tried petitioning Barr\\'s office to make sure that they can\\'t be identified in the published report. \"They got asked questions and told the truth,\" one unnamed official told NBC, \"and now they\\'re worried the wrath will follow.\" Needless to say, if the \"truth\" entirely consisted of nothing-to-see-here reminiscences, no one would be worried about having their name attached to them. The likelihood is high that details from the report will keep the White House press office busy for the next several weeks parrying criticisms and that they will make Trump\\'s \"the Mueller report was great\" victory lap look pretty silly. Trump has also insisted that the FBI spied on him in the campaign. That\\'s objectively true, as Barr noted in congressional testimony last week, as the investigation started as a counter-intelligence operation fueled by a surveillance warrant approved by a FISA court on Carter Page. That does not make it illegitimate, however, as Barr also noted. If the predicate for the warrant was valid, then the FBI\\'s operation was proper. Trump may be banking on data from the Mueller report justifying accusations that the FBI did not have a valid predicate for the warrant or surveillance and that the operation was politically motivated. If Mueller included that in his report, then Trump might get a big win — but if Mueller concludes that the FBI did have a valid reason to surveil Page, it\\'s going to burst that narrative bubble in a hurry. At this point, however, one has to wonder how engaged voters remain on Russiagate. With all of the indictments now public and no charges for collusion or obstruction resulting from the investigation, it seems most people outside the Beltway will not care terribly much about parsing out the details of Mueller\\'s report. Thursday\\'s release will be a letdown for both sides, which may just be what we need to finally move on from the special counsel probe as the center of our political attention.

       " 'Only a Trumpist could defeat Trump in a Republican primary \"The work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die.\" Ted Kennedy\\'s old line, delivered at the Democratic National Convention just three short months before Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter, was intended as a rallying cry for the confident liberalism that had set the tone and agenda for the nation\\'s politics over the previous three decades. But it ended up serving as an elegy. Nearly four decades later, one can imagine those words being recited as a morale-booster at a meeting of dead-ender Never-Trump Republicans as they mull over who should rise to the challenge of taking on the sitting president in next year\\'s GOP primaries. Will it be Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan? Or Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich? This week we learned that it would be former Massachusetts Gov. (and Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee) William Weld. Running for president is extremely difficult. Attempting to torpedo a president of one\\'s own party seeking re-election is nearly always something close to a political suicide mission. For all those reasons, we should accord anyone willing to make the attempt a modicum of respect. That certainly holds for Weld. But that doesn\\'t mean the effort makes sense. In this case, it makes no sense at all. Yes, President Trump is vulnerable in 2020. But he\\'s not vulnerable because the Republican electorate is pining for the opportunity to vote for another Jeb Bush or Mitt Romney — let alone a Jeb Bush or Mitt Romney who, like Weld, is pro-choice. The only kind of Republican who would have a shot of defeating the president in a primary would be a more competent Trumpist than Trump himself. The tiny faction of the Republican Party that openly loathes Trump enough to want to see him brought down in a kamikaze mission — a faction that enjoys outsized attention because it is vastly overrepresented in the media — has misread him from the start. First these Republicans considered Trump a sideshow and a buffoon whose sky-high poll numbers in the months leading up the start of 2016 primary season meant nothing. Surely the voters would come around and cast ballots for Bush or Kasich or Marco Rubio or Chris Christie or (God forbid) Ted Cruz over the reality-show carnival barker. Then they assumed Trump\\'s string of early primary victories would give way to defeat once the anybody-but-Trump vote coalesced around a suitable alternative. Then they were sure Trump\\'s clinching of the nomination would be overturned at the Republican National Convention. Then they were convinced he would lose in a landslide to Hillary Clinton. When he didn\\'t, many of them came to believe, finally, that he was certain to be removed from office by impeachment, a Robert-Mueller-facilitated indictment, or the invocation of the 25th Amendment. They\\'ve been wrong every step of the way. And they are wrong now. There are Republicans who wish Trump would tone down his unpresidential tweeting, and some who are offended by his tabloid bluster. But there are hardly any who are anything other than thrilled with his administration\\'s commitment to cutting taxes and regulations, appointing conservative judges and Supreme Court justices, pulling back from our overseas obligations, and \"trigging the libs\" on every possible front of the culture war (including some that Trump is single-handedly responsible for opening up). That\\'s why, even after more than two years of scandal and unprecedented political turbulence in Washington, roughly 90 percent of Republicans approve of the president\\'s performance. That doesn\\'t mean they like him personally or would invite him to date their daughters. It means they like how he\\'s doing his job. That\\'s true even in New Hampshire, where voters have a history of using their narrative-forming-first-primary-in-the-nation advantage to throw wrenches into the best-laid political plans. While a February poll showed Weld pulling in a not-entirely-humiliating 18 percent against the president, that still left Trump with an overwhelming 82 percent of Republican support. (Since Weld held office just across the border in Massachusetts, he\\'s hardly an unknown quantity in the Granite State.) By contrast, in the most notorious challenge to a sitting president in recent history, Pat Buchanan managed to win more than double that (37.5 percent) against George H. W. Bush in the 1992 New Hampshire primary. It\\'s become conventional wisdom that Buchanan\\'s challenge to Bush from the right weakened him greatly, preparing the way for Bill Clinton\\'s victory. Indeed, those looking to sink Trump hope that something similar will play out in 2020. There\\'s just one thing missing from the plan: Ross Perot. Were it not for Perot\\'s independent bid for the presidency in 1992, Bush may well have won re-election. It was the one-two punch of Buchanan slamming him from the right in the primaries followed by Perot hitting him from the center that did Bush in. A centrist-libertarian challenge to Trump in the primaries isn\\'t going to go anywhere. The only thing that would have any (though still very small) chance of success would be a campaign from the same ideological quadrant the president occupies: right-wing populism. It would have to be a Trump without the unpresidential tweets, a Trump who can keep his eye on the ball, who isn\\'t constantly undermining himself with performative contradictions and flagrant displays of rank ineptitude. This doesn\\'t mean the promise of a nicer president. It means the promise of an equally nasty but far more competent president — one who could accomplish even more for the Trumpified right. That isn\\'t at all what Weld and his allies have in mind. Donald Trump owns the Republican Party. He has remade it in his own image.

       " \"America is not responsible for Venezuela The drums of war are beating once again in the nation's capital. Many Republicans may privately curse the president's bizarre behavior and questionable judgment. Democrats may fret about the administration's incipient fascism. But the prospect of a war to topple a foreign government — in this case the government of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela — is all it takes to restore a sense of bipartisan comity in Washington. At last, something to make everyone feel good about themselves, united in the common cause of demonstrating our power and righteousness. In reality, military intervention in the standoff in Venezuela will only display our hubris and incapacity to learn from mistakes. Let's make one thing perfectly clear: Maduro's predecessor as president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, single-handedly wrecked the country's economy, and Maduro has made it far worse. The people of Venezuela would be better off if Maduro stepped down, allowing Juan Guaidó, president of the National Assembly, to take over as interim president, with elections to follow. But that doesn't mean that the United States should be placing itself in the role of orchestrating these events, especially if doing so requires the use of military force to remove Maduro and install Guaidó. What happens inside Venezuela simply isn't our responsibility. The question that cries out for an answer is why so many Americans conclude otherwise. Bad things happen in the world. Governments make mistakes, treat their citizens poorly, violate their rights, exacerbate their suffering. Everyone with a sense of moral decency and a capacity for empathy will lament this reality. But that doesn't mean that it's our place to use our immense military might to change it. Why not? For one thing, because our government's singular responsibility is the well-being of Americans. It exceeds the capacity of any country, even one as wealthy and powerful as ours, to take on responsibility for the citizens of other nations — who live elsewhere, who are not members of our political community, who have no say in our political system, who contribute nothing in taxes or economic productivity to our government or country. The world is not a single political entity ruled by the American president and policed by the American military. But even if you deny this and insist that what happens inside a country on another continent does place a moral obligation on the American government and armed forces, there remains the matter of whether acting on its basis will actually make things better for those who are suffering — and what the moral consequences of failure will be. The fact is that the United States is extremely bad at this. Do we have the capacity to topple a foreign government? Yes, we certainly do. And we unquestionably love to do it. The hatred of tyrants is a very old American national trait. But what comes next? We easily overthrew the Taliban in Afghanistan 17 years ago; the country remains a basket case. We easily overthrew Saddam Hussein in Iraq nearly 16 years ago; it ignited a civil war that tore the country apart, led to over 100,000 deaths, and destabilized an entire region. We easily overthrew the government of Moammar Gadhafi in Libya eight years ago; the country has been consumed by violence ever since. How many times will the United States make the same mistake while refusing to learn any meaningful lesson at all? Deposing a government is relatively easy. Securing peace, preventing chaos, managing a transition to a functional government — one strong enough to maintain order but limited enough to be a meaningful improvement on the former regime — is extremely difficult. All of the evidence of recent history points toward it being a task that exceeds the capacity of the United States. In the specific case of Venezuela, the more Guaidó is viewed as owing his power to American intervention, the more his political enemies will ensure that he's known as a puppet of the United States, undermining any attempt to establish his own legitimacy and increasing the likelihood that the Venezuelan military opts to take charge instead. Do we then act to overthrow the Venezuelan military? And if so, what comes next? American occupation? An attempt to place someone else in charge? Or do we instead grow bored and weary, blame the natives for their failure to receive the selfless American gift of freedom, and give up, leaving the country to descend into the anarchy we have bequeathed to so many places over the past two decades? Have those itching for war done the hard thinking required to negotiate these exceedingly likely outcomes of American intervention? Nothing from the present or recent past gives us any reason to think so. That's why there can be no obligation to intervene — because there cannot be a moral duty to make things worse. So let's hope for the best in Venezuela but not suppose it's our responsibility to try and fix their problems for them. We will only end up implicating ourselves in the further suffering to follow.

       " 'Harry Reid\\'s misplaced nostalgia for George W. Bush Here we go again. It seems another outbreak of wistfulness for the presidency of George W. Bush is upon us. The source of that outbreak is somewhat improbable, though: Retired Nevada Sen. Harry Reid — the Democrat who once stood as one of Bush\\'s most vocal foes — is suddenly feeling nostalgic. \"He and I had our differences, but no one ever questioned his patriotism,\" Reid said of Bush in a CNN interview. \"Our battles were strictly political battles.\" President Trump, on the other hand, makes Reid miss having Bush in the Oval Office \"every day.\" Trump, of course, reacted to the comparison with an angry tweet. But Trump\\'s response, and Reid\\'s criticism, missed the point. In truth, the differences between the two presidents are distinctions of degree, not of kind, and they have been magnified by cheap nostalgia. George W. Bush was a very bad president. Donald Trump is worse. But in many ways, Trump\\'s presidency merely amplifies the worst tendencies of the Bush administration. If you need an illustration, just look to Capitol Hill, where the House of Representatives is expected to vote to overturn Trump\\'s recent declaration of a national emergency designed to bypass Congress in order to build an anti-immigrant wall on America\\'s southern border. Trump\\'s attempt to end-run Congress is plainly unconstitutional, but it is also rooted in the excesses of the Bush administration during the first years after 9/11, when the president and his lawyers routinely asserted the right to disregard Congress on everything from decisions to build new military bases, make personnel appointments, and even torture terror suspects. In so many ways — right down to their shared tendency to hand out stupid, belittling nicknames — Bush laid the foundation for Trump. Here are three more examples: First, Bush practiced the politics of divide and conquer. Rather than try to broaden his appeal, his campaign in 2004 decided instead to focus on getting the GOP base to the polls — and did so by promoting a series of anti-gay measures on state ballots throughout the country: Eleven states, including Ohio, passed bans on gay marriage, which gave Bush a narrow victory in that year\\'s election. His victory came at the expense of an oppressed and scapegoated minority. That effort is clearly echoed in Trump\\'s push to build the wall, an anti-immigrant measure that is widely unpopular except within the narrow confines of the president\\'s base. Second, the Bush administration made clear early on it favored tax cuts over fiscal responsibility. Bush, you\\'ll remember inherited a budget surplus from President Clinton when he entered office in 2001. When he left office in 2009, the national debt had doubled. Under Trump, the national debt has topped $22 trillion. Republicans talk a lot about the sins of deficit spending, but they\\'re the worst practitioners when they hold the White House. Democrats are usually left to clean up the mess rather than pursue their own priorities. Finally, Bush\\'s disasters — in Iraq, during Hurricane Katrina, and in leaving behind the Great Recession — so tainted his family\\'s name that when 2016 rolled around, his big brother Jeb was easily dispatched by Trump during the GOP primaries, despite Jeb\\'s massive financial backing from the party establishment. A party that has traditionally nominated establishment favorites for the presidency instead gave the reins to a reality TV star. The similarities between the two men are both political — consider the disregard each has shown for longtime American allies — and personal. Both men seemed to fail upwards into the presidency, able to sustain their careers thanks mainly to the money and connections of their more-accomplished fathers.  There are differences, but they mostly come down to style: Bush appears more amiable than Trump. But the presidency isn\\'t a congeniality contest. In all the ways that matter, the two men are far too similar. There\\'s no reason for Reid or anybody else to feel nostalgia for Bush\\'s presidency. The nation\\'s 43rd president left the country in worse shape than he found it; Trump seems destined to do the same. All of us should be hoping it\\'s not too long before Trump joins Bush in retirement.

       " 'Why must you go to school to be a barber — or a nurse? One of my favorite oldster groans is the one directed at college students who have fallen for Hegel or Japanese art history or, heaven help us, philology: Why don\\'t you do something practical instead, like learn to cut hair? The answer is that, of course, some people do. This doesn\\'t save them from the educational-industrial complex. The New York Times reported recently on the plight of a young woman in Iowa who went $21,000 into debt in order to obtain a \"license\" for cutting hair and filing and shaping fingernails. Tracy Lozano is an eminently practical young woman who if interested in Sanskirt verbs or Dogu statues of the late Jomon period has wisely decided to save these things for the weekend and earn a living instead. After investing roughly the price of a down payment on a reasonably nice home in rural Iowa on this piece of paper, she found herself eligible for a position at a Great Clips chain that paid her $9 an hour. Even after supplementing her guild-sponsored employment with another job — at Pizza Hut: apparently dough-folding and cheese-scattering have so far managed to remain outside the purview of Hawkeye state licensing authorities — she was able to earn about $25,000 a year. After 13 years of work she still owes the Iowa School of Beauty by way of her creditors more than $8,000. This is insane. I won\\'t go as far as some of the old farmers I know who insist that anybody with two hands and half a brain can drive an 18-wheeler, but I do think it\\'s hard not to argue that American credentialism is out of hand and getting worse. (As recently as 2015, the state of Tennessee decided that barbers had to have high-school diplomas, no doubt because the otherwise lively discussions of To Kill a Mockingbird and quadratic equations that take place in such establishments were being drowned out by the raving of these unlicensed maniacs.) I for one believe that commercial drivers licenses are a necessary thing. Ditto the restrictions that we rightly impose upon the ability of any lunatic to declare himself a dentist and start drilling away with the Crafstman in his garage. But hair? Come on. This isn\\'t exactly life or death. Besides, expensive credentialing requirements have failed to rid the world of bad haircuts. If the guildmasters at the various state licensing boards really believed their own drivel, they would take one look at what happened to Shia LeBeouf here and start demanding that cosmetologists devote six or more years to writing dissertations on \"The history of bangs in France: 1960-1963\" before they so much as touch a pair of clippers. When I was a writing tutor at one of our directional state universities years ago, I often assisted nursing students. These were invariably among the cleverest and most conscientious undergraduates I ever worked with. They were also the nicest. Most of them were if not happy at least willing to spend four years of their lives memorizing the types of plankton in biology courses. They were less enthusiastic about the cost. But they put up with it for the very simple reason that they all wanted one thing: to help people. We should not put a financial barrier between would-be nurses and their worthy ambition. This is true, among other reasons, because it is not at all clear that the ability to earn high grades in what is essentially a pre-medical school curriculum is the most important quality in a prospective nurse. But the answer to the student debt crisis here is not to throw trillions of dollars of free tuition money at the pizza dispensers and bureaucrats and dorm-upgrading contractors in the universities but to make it possible for people to work as nurses without earning four-year degrees. In the 1940s the United States and Britain managed to train hundreds of thousands of nurses virtually overnight with nothing but practical, on-the-job training. Already there is a widespread consensus among practicing nurses in the United Kingdom that degree programs are unnecessary. We should follow their lead. A two-year training course at a community college, combined with practical experience in hospitals, should be enough. The same is true of my own profession. In happier times, journalism was a blue-collar job for drunks in hats who banged out nonsense with typewriters they positioned in corners of their favorite saloons. Nowadays we have undergraduate and graduate degrees in writing the news. A lot of good it\\'s done the industry. You could draw an amusing graph plotting the decline of newspapers across the country against the rise of journalism as a pseudo-academic discipline. The prospect of having to sit through hundreds of hours of yawn-inducing pseudoscience about pedagogy has prevented more than one person — the author of this column included — from becoming a teacher. Anyone with a degree in a relevant area — English, history, foreign languages — should be able to teach it at the secondary level. Don\\'t get me wrong. As someone with a penchant for guild socialism, I like to dream of a neo-medievalist future where the Barbers Society and the Sovereign Nurses Guild and the Fraternity of Mostly Sober Hacks require their would-be initiates to undergo years of elaborate and highly ritualized training — and even organize singing contests among members. In the real world, though, someone who wants to give me a buzz cut or help me lose weight or advise me on my choice of houseplants needs a special piece of paper about as much he or she does a sentence to involuntary debt servitude. Too bad those are the same thing.

In a preview clip from Fox News\\' Sean Hannity\\'s Super Bowl interview with the president set to air Sunday, Trump is asked about Bloomberg. He said the only word he can think about when he ponders the man he\\'s dubbed \"Mini Mike\" is \"little.\" The president then went all in on a conspiracy theory he\\'s developed — and tweeted — about Bloomberg negotiating with the DNC about standing on a platform so the Democratic presidential candidate appears taller during televised debates. Trump reportedly thinks that would be very unfair. \"Does that mean everyone else gets a box?,\" he asked. Trump did say, however, that it\\'s okay to \"be short.\"  the conspiracy Trump has landed on about Bloomberg is that he likes to stand on a box https://t.co/3ViMleyTm4 — Edward-Isaac Dovere (@IsaacDovere) February 2, 2020  The Bloomberg campaign said there\\'s no basis to Trump\\'s claim.

Djokovic was down two sets to one and at one point lost six straight games to Thiem, but he settled down and secured the victory in five sets, 6-4, 4-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4. It\\'s the 32-year-old Serbian\\'s eighth Australian Open crown and his second in a row. With the win, Djokovic inches closer to Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, who have 20 and 19 Grand Slam titles, respectively, and are both older than their on-court rival, giving him a real chance to emerge from the era of tripartite dominance with the most hardware. Djokovic will also reportedly supplant Nadal as the world\\'s no. 1 men\\'s player as a result of the Melbourne win. The 26-year-old Thiem has now appeared in three major titles, but has yet to get his hands on a trophy after previously losing twice to Nadal in the last two French Opens. One day, perhaps, Djokovic and Nadal will hang \\'em up. Read more at ESPN.

If so, Saturday Night Live\\'s latest cold open provided its audience with a look at what might\\'ve been. Saturday evening\\'s episode opened with a disinterested Chief Justice John Roberts (played by Mikey Day) presiding over the Senate trial as he\\'s doing in real life, only to be quickly replaced by Kenan Thompson\\'s Judge Greg Mathis, who injected some enthusiasm into the previously listless proceedings.

Tim O\\'Donnell  Philippines reports first coronavirus death outside China The Philippines reported the first death resulting from the Wuhan coronavirus outside of China on Sunday. A 44-year-old man who tested positive for the new coronavirus died Saturday in the Philippines after developing what officials called \"severe pneumonia.\" He was reportedly in stable condition until the final 24 hours before his condition \"deteriorated.\" The patient was a native of Wuhan, China, where the virus appears to have originated. He arrived in the Philippines in January with a 38-year-old woman who also tested positive for the coronavirus and remains isolated in a hospital in Manila. In China, officials reported Sunday that the country\\'s death toll rose to at least 304 people while the worldwide total of confirmed cases — the vast majority within China — has reached nearly 14,380, per Chinese and World Health Organization data.

       " 'Trump isn\\'t rolling back the American empire. He\\'s expanding it. Is President Trump really rolling back the American empire? His isolationist cheerleaders insist the answer is \"yes.\" If you look past his bellicosity to his \"America First\" foreign policy, they say, you\\'ll find the seeds of ending decades of neoconservative interventionism and limiting the country\\'s military engagements to areas where some vital national interest is at stake. But they\\'re fooling themselves. Trump is not diminishing America\\'s military footprint; if anything, he\\'s expanding it. This is a shame. Given America\\'s growing empire, it would certainly be nice if a president would pull back — and try and change the world by example instead of picking fights or aiding wars. Trump, unfortunately, is not the man for the job. As evidence for their position, the president\\'s boosters cite his pullouts from Afghanistan and Syria, as well as his willingness to meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un to negotiate his country\\'s nuclear disarmament. But the latter diplomatic overture is shaping up to be a complete bust, and the former pullouts are just as partial as former President Obama\\'s was from Iraq. Just as Obama ended up succumbing and leaving a rump American force in Iraq, Trump too, for all his tough talk, has flipped on his original promise to fully withdraw from Syria. He is saying now that he\\'s \"100 percent\" on board with a residual troop presence. Likewise in Afghanistan, he\\'s talking only about withdrawing half the American troops — not all. Trump\\'s supporters are also ecstatic that he is questioning the NATO alliance — except that he\\'s not. All he wants is that NATO countries reimburse America for its costs, not take responsibility for their own defense. In fact, The New York Times\\' Ross Douthat believes that Trump wants these countries to bear their military burden so that America\\'s resources are freed up to deal with China, a country that for some reason has always rubbed Trump the wrong way. In fairness, a NATO pullout would provoke considerable political resistance. So it may be understandable why Trump wouldn\\'t prioritize it. But Trump doesn\\'t want to pull out even from disputes such as Saudi Arabia\\'s offensive against Houthi insurgents in Yemen where there is widespread consensus that America has no business getting involved. The Senate even passed a resolution 54-47 last week demanding that Trump stop using American forces to assist Saudis with midair refueling and target assistance, especially since he has no Congressional authorization to do so. Trump\\'s response? A pledge to veto the bill. But why exactly is Trump so gung-ho about helping Saudi Arabia, a monstrous regime that killed and dismembered an American resident because he had the temerity to criticize it? Apparently because Houthis are Shia Muslims like most Iranians — and Trump\\'s hawkish advisers are telling him that if the Houthis take over Yemen they would ally with Iran against Israel, America\\'s ally. But these are exactly the kind of geo-political considerations that \"America First\" was supposed to reject. At least in Saudi Arabia\\'s case Trump is providing \"only\" indirect military assistance. Not so in Somalia. The administration has escalated America\\'s three-decade long military campaign against al-Shabab, an inconsequential Somali terrorist group whose less than 500 hard-core members pose virtually no threat to America. The saving grace, if there is one, is that the administration at least designated Somalia as an \"active area of hostilities,\" which will force Pentagon to disclose how many casualties its drone attacks cause. However, CIA drones bomb countries covertly all over the world without such a designation. President Obama at the tail end of his presidency issued an executive order requiring the agency to report these strikes along with assessments of the combatants and non-combatants it killed. But Trump last week scrapped this requirement so that the CIA can once again kill with impunity without worrying about bad publicity. One reason why the American empire is on an unbroken growth trajectory is that a giant behemoth like the Pentagon has to justify its existence by inventing or exaggerating threats. Only a president determined to starve the beast would ultimately be able to shrink America\\'s military presence around the world. And during his campaign, Trump lamented that if America had spent $6 trillion at home instead of the Middle East, \"we could have rebuilt our country twice.\" However, now that Trump is in office he is doing the opposite. His most recent budget proposed to cut domestic spending by 5 percent and boost defense spending by the same amount, never mind that America already spends more than the next seven powers combined on defense. To add insult to injury, Trump is boosting America\\'s defensive capabilities less and offensive ones more, given that his budget seeks to cut spending on defensive missile systems by $500 million while increasing it on offensive systems such as hypersonic weapons by $2.6 billion. Worst of all, Trump doesn\\'t just want to use the American military to accomplish his foreign policy objectives; he is also enlisting the American economy, wielding sanctions and tariffs like weapons. He tore up Obama\\'s nuclear deal with Iran, re-imposing sanctions on the country and anyone that does business with it. And it\\'s not just Iran. In 2017, Trump imposed a record 944 sanctions on foreign entities and individuals. And then he topped his own record and imposed over 1,000 sanctions last year. The Guardian\\'s Simon Tisdall notes that soon any country not under economic attack by Trump will be the exception rather than the rule. Using America\\'s economy as a handmaiden of its foreign policy was always a neoconservative goal. Back in the 1990s, neocons vehemently opposed permanently normalizing trade ties with China because they wanted to make access to America\\'s markets subject to China doing their bidding. Trump\\'s \"America First,\" thus, isn\\'t so much a departure from neo-conservatism as a different — and worse — version of it. In its zeal to impose America\\'s will on the rest of the world, it is just as meddlesome and aggressive — but with less consensus-building abroad and accountability at home. Expecting Trump to rollback the American empire is a fool\\'s dream.

       " 'Bill de Blasio 2020: The campaign no one wants Poor Bill de Blasio. Did you know that he is the tallest municipal leader in any major American city? This is probably the only interesting fact about the mayor of New York, but he never gets any credit for it. It certainly doesn\\'t help that both of his immediate predecessors have been iconic figures: The image of Michael Bloomberg as a soda-grabbing billionaire technocrat weirdo looms very large in the popular imagination, and Rudy Giuliani is a beloved right-wing meme. In his home state, de Blasio doesn\\'t even win the superlative for being the most craven politician, an honor that belongs to the Democratic governor, Andrew \"Amazon\" Cuomo. Can someone please think up a memorable nickname for him that is not a mild ethnic slur? De Blasio\\'s reported interest in seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination is so pathetic that it makes the long-shot candidacy of his fellow mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, seem inspiring in comparison. All of this came into painfully sharp relief over the weekend when a whopping 20 people showed up to see de Blasio appear at a roundtable on mental health in New Hampshire. Fourteen of them were invited members of the panel. If a politician gives a speech in an early primary state and no one hears it, did it really happen? Yes, but only because of the internet. When party kingmakers say that de Blasio is \"non-existent in Iowa,\" they mean it literally. There are obvious reasons for this. Outside of New York, de Blasio\\'s political career would be utterly incomprehensible even to ordinary Democratic primary voters, among whom he enjoys the dubious distinction of being the only would-be 2020 contender with a net negative favorability rating. Here is a Democrat who belongs to no recognizable national wing of his party. He is not a DSA-lite progressive or a Midwestern moderate or a centrist hawk. He is servitude to woke capital in human form, a man of the people who travels in a two-SUV convoy to work out at his old neighborhood gym every morning. Under de Blasio all of New York\\'s much-lamented problems have gotten worse. Despite his verbal commitment to affordable housing it has never been more expensive to live in the city. Five years after the release of \"Rising Together: The De Blasio Vision For New York City Transportation,\" the disgusting trash labyrinth that is the city\\'s public transit system is less reliable than it was when he took office. The best way to tell that de Blasio doesn\\'t care about something is if he makes noise about it. As a candidate he was a relentless critic of the New York Police Department; after being elected he promptly appointed Bill Bratton, who had held the job under Giuliani, as police commissioner. As far as I can tell his only real accomplishments in office are changing his mind in the most baffling and publicly humiliating manner possible about the erstwhile \"mission critical\" Amazon headquarters project and harassing the city\\'s poor mohels. He also wants to legalize dope. In the concrete jungle that is New York politics, de Blasio has the benefit of being the last bad choice for a narrow plurality of several million people whose views on a wide range of issues are out of step with those of the average American. There he is acceptable as someone who can pay lip service to various socially liberal causes while allowing developers to turn Manhattan into the odd combination of ghost town and luxury resort that it is today. Anywhere else he comes off as, well, exactly what he is: the least inspiring stooge for the donor class imaginable, a dream candidate for Republicans who would combine the woke posturing of a Beto O\\'Rourke with the sordid record of a Kamala Harris and the soaring oratory of a Tim Kaine. The world\\'s smartest computer could not algorithmically generate a worse Democrat in 2020. President Trump really should encourage him.

       " 'The politics of getting pregnant in Trump\\'s America In the months leading up to the 2016 presidential election, my best friend told me something deeply personal: \"We\\'re not sure if we\\'re having another baby,\" she said. \"We\\'re going to wait and see what happens.\" Specifically, she was waiting anxiously to see if Donald Trump would win. Other friends shared similar sentiments during the vitriolic election season. \"I hear you,\" I said, as footage of Trump and the words \"grab \\'em by the pussy\" flashed across my TV screen. \"These are scary times.\" The truth was, my partner and I were also thinking about having another baby. And while I shared my friends\\' trepidations, a voice inside of me whispered: \"I am ready now. Do I really have to wait?\" My biology concurred, as did my partner. A week after Election Day, I threw up in the toilet. I was pregnant. Anxiety is a normal part of parenthood. When you assume responsibility for a child\\'s life, there comes a deep and relentless sense of vulnerability. Over the past few years, though, the emerging sociopolitical landscape — a climate of polarization and uncertainty — has heightened anxiety for both parents and non-parents across America. The American Psychological Association has recorded an increase in national anxiety among Republicans and Democrats alike; their surveys point to \"election stress\" and \"current political climate\" as significant factors. It is hardly a surprise, then, that in such conditions, people feel discouraged about starting or growing their families. Why bring children into a world that makes you despair? This sentiment isn\\'t just anecdotal, it is quantifiable. A recent study found that demand for long-term birth control — like IUDs and implants — rose more than 20 percent in the month after the 2016 election. While the researchers suggest one reason for the rise could be a growing concern about accessibility to birth control, I would venture to guess that anxiety about what the future would be like for kids and parents may have also have played a role here. When I was pregnant with my first baby, the future seemed big and bright. Barack Obama was president, and hope was a natural byproduct of the \"yes we can\" era. For me, a white middle-class person, hope was also easy enough to take for granted. I did not follow the news obsessively because I trusted that the system, including its checks and balances, was reasonably on track. I trusted the nation\\'s highest office was occupied by a person with dignity, values, and moral conscience. There was a strong sense that much of the world nodded in approval. Believing our country to be stable and fairly united afforded me the luxury of turning inward, towards the transformation of motherhood; a privilege for which I was — and still am — very grateful. But now, everything feels different. Sometimes it even feels hopeless. Our country no longer welcomes immigrants in with open arms or aims to uplift families; if you work hard, there is no guarantee you will be able to pay your bills, afford health care, or climb up in the socioeconomic ranks. True, Trump cannot be blamed entirely for these injustices, but his policies inarguably further economic inequality; threaten the rights of women, minorities, and the LGBTQ community; promote xenophobia; and ignore the catastrophic impact of climate change. Hate crimes and the raging suicide and opioid epidemics have increased sharply under his regime. After I found out I was pregnant, anxiety quickly dampened my excitement as I fretted about the future. The growing curve of my belly represented a vivid divide between the peacefulness of my inner sanctum and the toxic, fear-based culture churning on the outside. I struggled to reconcile this odd feeling of nurturing innocence during a time of turmoil, hate, and mistrust. I found myself alternating between both sides of the divide: either humming softly and turning in tenderly towards my baby — or baring my teeth and growling at the news reel like a mama wolf protecting her pup. I thought about how mothers all around the world give birth in much more extreme conditions, and the strength and courage they live by every day, and this humbled me. But in a way, I was in no hurry for my baby to come out. On Inauguration Day, I was three months pregnant. I lay alone on the couch, curled into a ball, watching the transfer of powers on TV. While mourning the loss of the nation\\'s first female president, I also prepared for a future of guaranteed patriarchy. I wondered: What would it mean for our two little girls to grow up during the Trump era? My baby was estimated for arrival on the same day as a solar eclipse — one of the darkest days of the year — which felt fitting somehow. On that day, I remember the moon smudging out the sun. For a few eerie moments, darkness took over. When my baby chose a different day to be born, the sun was reassuringly high in the sky, and I felt grateful and ready for her to come out. My baby is 17 months old now. Under Trump, American women face some dire prospects: soaring economic inequalities, rising health-care prices, rocketing educational costs and debts, along with attempts to roll back reproductive rights. And yet, despite it all, I remain hopeful. Every day, I watch my baby grow more independent, more fully integrated, more alive in this complicated world. When we visit the bunny rabbits at the local farm and her pudgy arms and legs dance excitedly, or she pretend-reads Goodnight Gorilla in her sister\\'s lap, I can\\'t help but smile. As a mother navigating the troubled waters of our times, I strive to remain optimistic for the sake of my daughters. I believe it\\'s my job to uphold the same values of hope, love, and truth that our children unconsciously espouse. What I have come to understand, and feel ever so deeply, is that children are always a blessing — and good reminder not to succumb to the current climate of fear. 7 beautiful homes in the Piedmont The long road to fatherhood for gay men in China The joy and sadness of being surpassed by your kids Mitch McConnell does it again Lamar Alexander suggests he may have decided differently on witnesses if some House Republicans voted to impeach Trump 5 royally funny cartoons about Trump\\'s impeachment defense': 1,\n",
       " 'The bloody cost of Islamophobia The appalling massacre of 49 Muslims at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on Thursday naturally has people around the world looking for explanations. Proximate motivations were not hard to discover. The alleged terrorist, a 28-year-old man from Australia, posted a white supremacist tract online where he lauded President Trump as a \"symbol of white identity.\" He livestreamed the shooting, in which he repeated many white nationalist slogans and recommended that viewers \"subscribe to PewDiePie\" (YouTube\\'s most popular independent channel, which is somehow constantly getting in trouble for \"ironic\" racism). One important aspect of this horror is how the internet enables the spread of genocidal propaganda. Worldwide peer-to-peer communication networks makes it easier than ever for hatred and racist conspiracy theories to spread. But just as important is the political background. Powerful conservative activists, media figures, and politicians around the world have deliberately stoked hysterical anti-Muslim bigotry for political advantage. It should not be surprising if occasionally some of their supporters follow their words to their logical conclusions. Ben Shapiro — whose tweets, according to Canadian court documents, were regularly read by Alexandre Bissonnette, the right-wing terrorist who shot up a Quebec mosque — has used ridiculously slanted statistics to argue that the majority of Muslims (or 800 million people, by his count) are \"radical\" terrorist sympathizers. He has also promoted an article he allegedly edited saying that Muslims living in Europe constitute a \"disease\" and that Muslim men are \"uncivilized.\" David French wrote in National Review in 2015 (again wildly exaggerating the implications of opinion polls) that the Muslim world is \"overcome with hate\" and that \"jihadists represent the natural and inevitable outgrowth of a faith that is given over to hate on a massive scale.\" This kind of thinking — many if not most Muslims are terrorists or \"radicals,\" and should be collectively instead of individually judged — is why President Trump has stoked fear about Muslims sneaking across the southern border and proposed (and partly accomplished) banning all Muslim entry into the United States. Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) — who, among other things, accused the Obama administration of being infiltrated by the Muslim Brotherhood — implicitly admitted some overlap with the Christchurch terrorist. He argued in a statement not that the murderer\\'s racism was wrong, but that he didn\\'t use the correct channels: \"There are courts, dispute resolutions, and legislatures to resolve controversies[.]\" Which \"controversy\" he means is left as an exercise for the reader. An extreme right-wing Australian senator named Fraser Anning straight-up blamed the victims themselves for the massacre, issuing a statement that read: \"The real cause of the bloodshed ... is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place … just because the followers of this savage belief were not the killers in this instance, that does not make them blameless.\" This barely-veiled apologia for terrorism conceals a strong political motive. Indeed, this is far from the first time that powerful right-wingers have attempted to stoke bigotry for political advantage. In Imperial Russia in 1911, for instance, the top levels of the tsarist government (including the minister of justice and Tsar Nicholas II himself) conspired to frame a Jewish clerk named Menachem Mendel Beilis for the \"ritual murder\" of a Ukrainian boy — a classic piece of blood libel anti-Semitism. The actual murderers (who were not Jews) were quickly discovered by police and journalists, but the authorities hushed it up. The case attracted a storm of international condemnation, but the tsarist regime pressed on with the frame-up. The reason is that the frenzy of hatred served an important political function — namely, building mass popular support for the autocracy. (Luckily for Beilis, the prosecution\\'s case was so shoddy that he was acquitted at trial.) Similar to how war fever can inspire mass demonstrations of patriotic loyalty, stoking violent anti-Semitism (which produced clockwork bloody pogroms from reactionary \"Black Hundreds\" militias) provided both some social glue for a right-wing empire and a convenient scapegoat for any problems that cropped up. In the end, it didn\\'t save Imperial Russia, but the truly enormous potential of political bigotry would later be demonstrated by Hitler and Nazi Germany. Political Islamophobia from Alaska to Australia serves as a key ideological unifier for modern right-wing movements, because they have little policy content which is practically useful for their mass base. Right-wing oligarchs like Trump may not actually roll back globalization, or do any major domestic policy but tax cuts and deregulation, but they can provide a compelling (and wholly fictional) narrative of white civilization under threat. White supremacist terrorism across the whole Western world is just the price to be paid.

       " 'The grave dangers of Trump\\'s \\'patriotic correctness\\' Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) misspoke. In a speech about Islam and civil liberties in America, she described the 9/11 attacks with a phrase — \"some people did something\" — far too casual. In context, Omar\\'s words were an inartful expression of a legitimate frustration: that, in the wake of this horror, the U.S. security state went into hyperdrive, and the rights of the innocent many were violated because of the abhorrent deeds of the guilty few. Out of context, her words have become a jingoistic cause célèbre. Naturally, President Trump got in on the action, tweeting a video which juxtaposed Omar\\'s phrase with graphic footage of the terror attacks. Omar reported receiving a \"sharp increase\" in death threats after the tweet, many of them explicitly referencing Trump\\'s post. But, presented with this information by a local reporter while visiting Omar\\'s home state on Monday, the president was unconcerned. He had no second thoughts about the tweet, Trump said, \"not at all.\" Omar has \"got a way about her that\\'s very, very bad, I think, for our country,\" he continued. \"I think she\\'s extremely unpatriotic and extremely disrespectful to our country.\" The logic here is stunning: For those who demonstrate insufficient patriotism, death threats are no problem. In fact, they may even be appropriate. Fail to adequately perform uncritical affection for the United States and it will be noticed and punished. Real Americans police each other\\'s patriotism, Trump seems to be saying, and those who are \"extremely unpatriotic and extremely disrespectful to our country\" cannot expect to get off scot-free. Of course, it goes without saying that controversial speech will have consequences. Omar could not anticipate — and I very much doubt she did anticipate — that her speech would be met with universal agreement or even silence from those who don\\'t share her views. No politician with a national profile would be naive enough to imagine she could avoid confrontation; in this very speech, in fact, Omar called on American Muslims to be willing to \"make people uncomfortable\" in their civil rights activism if necessary. But there is a chasm between the consequences Omar could have rightfully expected (criticism, denunciation, lost votes, lost office) and those she got (death threats, fueled in part by a tweet from the president, who does not regret his role in inspiring what are hopefully empty menaces to Omar\\'s life). The former is appropriate and normal — part of participating in public conversation in a country like ours. The latter is what happens when patriotism goes awry, when devotion to the nation-state takes a turn toward the idolatrous, when we stop wanting what is best for our communities and simply want to be the best, unchallenged by even what is intended as constructive critique. This poisonous sort of patriotism — I\\'ll use Trump\\'s word, though \"nationalism\" would serve as well — is jealous and officious by nature. It demands to be complete, so it requires its observants be ever vigilant for dissent. The result is what the Cato Institute\\'s Alex Nowrasteh has astutely dubbed \"patriotic correctness\": It\\'s a full-throated, un-nuanced, uncompromising defense of American nationalism, history, and cherry-picked ideals. Central to its thesis is the belief that nothing in America can\\'t be fixed by more patriotism enforced by public shaming, boycotts, and policies to cut out foreign and non-American influences. Insufficient displays of patriotism among the patriotically correct can result in exclusion from public life and ruined careers. It also restricts honest criticism of failed public policies, diverting blame for things like the war in Iraq to those Americans who didn\\'t support the war effort enough. [Alex Nowrasteh via The Washington Post] For those operating with a full-blown case of patriotic correctness — and Trump is unquestionably one of the fever\\'s Typhoid Marys — \"anything less than chest-thumping jingoism is capitulation\" to those perceived to be America\\'s enemies, Nowrasteh writes. It is, in effect, a type of treason (which, recall, is a death penalty offense. Trump\\'s comfort with his role in Omar\\'s receipt of death threats makes a certain grim sense by this rationale). Thus it is no surprise to find Trump employing “treason” language with some regularity. \"I think what the Democrats are doing with the Border is TREASONOUS,\" he tweeted last week, two days before posting the Omar video. This is a blatantly false accusation: Democrats\\' border security policies, whatever we think of them, simply do not fit the Constitution\\'s intentionally precise definition of treason, which was narrowly crafted to avoid the abuse of this charge practiced by the monarchs of old Europe. Kings who claimed to govern by divine right could levy charges of treason to suppress public dissent. Presidents of a nation ostensibly governed by its people — people who disagree on many things, immigration and our policy response to 9/11 both included — are not supposed to do the same. That Trump does so, and that he does it with the support or at least indifference of so many, should serve as a glaring warning against the ugliness the patriotic correctness he practices can produce. Any demand of loyalty that has us making, condoning, or downplaying threats of murder over a crude turn of phrase is a loyalty imbalanced. It does not benefit our country, and it is no virtue.

       " 'Trump\\'s Fed picks are awful — but not for the reasons you think Make no mistake about it: President Trump\\'s latest picks for the Federal Reserve are terrible. A cursory study of Stephen Moore and Herman Cain shows they have no substantive or coherent views on monetary policy; they\\'re simply apparatchiks and yes-men for the current leadership of the Republican Party. It\\'s very likely Cain\\'s nomination will be unsuccessful, thanks in part to resounding rejections from a handful of key Republicans. Still, it\\'s worth noting that not all arguments against these nominees stand up to scrutiny. The loudest objection suggests that putting Moore and Cain on the Fed would jeopardize the central bank\\'s independence, undermine the Fed\\'s ability to properly stabilize the economy, and threaten to deliver us into a Venezuela-style inflation crisis. This line of thinking assumes that the Fed is one of our last remaining credible, functioning, and non-political institutions. But that\\'s simply not true. Moore and Cain can\\'t ruin the Fed, because the Fed has been a failure for years. By any reasonable standard, the Fed\\'s \"credibility\" is a modern day myth. The central bank\\'s ability to set interest rates gives it immense power over Americans\\' economic fortunes: When the Fed raises interest rates, it holds down inflation, but at the cost of higher unemployment and slower wage growth for workers. (Lowering interest rates potentially allows more inflation, but also allows more economic growth.) Thus the Fed\\'s dual mandate from Congress: to keep inflation low and stable, but also to maximize employment. As the central bank\\'s many defenders point out, it absolutely nailed low and stable inflation over the last few decades. But it\\'s completely failed on the \"maximizing employment\" front. That failure laid much of the foundation for modern wage stagnation, inequality, the death of unions, rampant household insecurity, and a host of other social ills. Yet the economists, policymakers, and yes, even journalists, who actually get to judge the Fed\\'s \"credibility\" all tend to be upper class, which means the narrative that gets passed around about the Fed is overwhelmingly positive. After all, these people rarely suffer when unemployment spikes, even in the depths of a crisis like the Great Recession. Traditional Fed nominees themselves are equally elite. They often hail from a small and rarified socioeconomic slice of the population. Meanwhile, the people who do face the regular threat of joblessness and inadequate pay whenever the Fed decides to tamp down prices — low-income workers and minorities and other vulnerable Americans — remain far removed from the conversations surrounding the Fed. Putting Trump\\'s nominees on the Fed Board would not lead the Fed down the path of partisanship — it is already too far gone. As Neil Irwin perhaps inadvertently points out at The New York Times, the Fed\\'s monetary policy decisions inherently \"pit the interests of workers against owners of capital, and those of banks against those of consumers.\" Those decisions are nothing if not \"political.\" Fed officials routinely characterize empowered workers and labor movements that can actually force employers to meet their demands as threats to be neutralized. And they routinely set out to squash the share of national income that working Americans can claw away from wealthy shareholders. In fact, former Fed Chair Paul Volcker, who is widely credited with ending the 1970s inflation crisis and for inaugurating the Fed\\'s modern era of credibility, was pretty explicit about crushing unions and pushing down the incomes of working Americans. No one ever seems to worry that it\\'s the business leaders, Wall Street, or the capital-owning class — not politicians themselves — who might push the Fed into over-prioritizing low inflation, and create a permanent semi-slump. Yet if you look back at the last 30 years, a permanent semi-slump is pretty much what we got. There is a more subtle argument to be made against Moore and Cain, which is that, being partisans, they may deliberately use monetary policy to make a recession worse if the other party happens to hold the White House. Fretting over this would make way more sense than the existential fear that they\\'d some how erode the Fed\\'s already non-existent credibility and independence. Indeed, the narrative in defense of the traditional Fed is almost entirely divorced from the problems the economy actually faces in the modern era. The desire to stick with traditional Fed picks would certainly rule out hacks like Moore and Cain. But it would also rule out nominees drawn from civil rights activists, leaders of Black Lives Matter, union representatives, community organizers, or anyone else who might bring a more populist, worker-friendly, or bottom-up perspective to the Fed\\'s priorities and deliberations. That Trump\\'s latest Fed picks would dispense with the norm of \"traditional\" nominees is probably the one positive thing that can be said for them.

       " 'Why are Silicon Valley billionaires starving themselves? Twitter founder and CEO and billionaire Jack Dorsey has more money than he could ever need — but he\\'s not acting like it. Unlike the self-made wealthy folk of years gone by, Dorsey and a growing number of top-earning tech entrepreneurs aren\\'t swilling vintage champagne and banqueting in their free time. Instead, they\\'re practicing an extreme form of self-denial that has me both troubled and puzzled. Dorsey recently appeared on the Ben Greenfield Fitness podcast to explain his monkish lifestyle in more detail than the 240 character blasts he\\'s known for sending out to the less biologically enlightened universe. He says he eats only one meal a day in the week and doesn\\'t let any foodstuff pass his lips at the weekend. He also starts every day with an ice bath. \"Nothing has given me more mental confidence than being able to go straight from room temperature into the cold,\" he says. And, rain or shine, he walks the five miles from his home to his office. It\\'s all part of his ever-evolving quest to keep his brain functioning at maverick CEO level. And, I suppose, outlive anyone silly enough to think that eating regular, balanced meals is sensible. Dorsey\\'s wellness-hacking habits are extrapolated from the ancient Greek and Roman philosophy of Stoicism, which says, essentially, that you should be happy with your lot (arguably not hard if you have a lot) and deny yourself nice things — like warm baths and calories on days that start with the letter \"s.\" Stoicism sounds like unscientific celebrity fad nonsense, yet it has a cult-like appeal to a demonstrably smart crew: Silicon Valley\\'s elite. Stoicism\\'s aficionados include Kevin Rose, co-founder of the website Digg, who embraces the philosophy by taking cold showers, not putting on a winter coat, and saying things like, \"I try to surrender to the Earth as everything unfolds around me, not judging it, but accepting things as they are.\" Which sounds like a lukewarm blend of meditation and shrugging. Former Evernote CEO and current CEO of AI studio All Turtles, Phil Libin, regularly says no to food for fasts that last more than a week. He\\'s lost nearly 90 pounds and now bandies around words like \"transformative.\" The man who rebooted Stoicism for today\\'s tech moguls is author, podcaster, and tech startup investor Tim Ferriss. He calls the philosophy \"an ideal operating system for thriving in high-stress environments.\" Maybe it is and maybe it isn\\'t. But one thing is for sure: There\\'s a danger in champions like Dorsey promoting extreme dietary choices that resemble eating disorders to their followers. It\\'s also curious, and a little chilling, that this rewrite of the tech elite lifestyle has come about at a time when powerful influencers and innovators are seeing their inventions harnessed by terrible people who do and say terrible things. In Dorsey\\'s case, he\\'s created a platform that has allowed populists, alt-right types, and Russian bots to spread their messages to vast new audiences, creating more chaos than he could possibly have imagined. Twitter undeniably helped make Donald Trump president and gave Britain\\'s Brexiteers a stage. And it\\'s used daily to mete out public shamings and takedowns. Dorsey has experienced how easy it is to create global pandemonium with a laptop and a smidgen of chutzpah. So for the Twitter CEO and his kind, trying to control biology with low-grade torture, plus a disinterest in traditional rich-people trappings, may be a kind of self-imposed penance for having built platforms and technology that have unleashed some pretty bad things on the world. I would argue that the motivations of these super-elites are plainly not the same as those of other Silicon Valley workers, who periodically jump on fads like soylent and micro dosing. These larks have more in common with gaming or cosplay, and tie into fanboy fantasies about next-level living in a STEM world. Stoicism is different. It asks that its followers dispense with all the sparkle, deliciousness, and fluff, and get back to humble basics. It\\'s a sort of reverse elitism that could also, potentially, blame-proof a tech billionaire\\'s legacy. \"I may have invented Twitter,\" Dorsey might say. \"But I walk to work and vacationed at spiritual retreats that look like refugee camps!\" Dorsey getting his monk on publicly is winning him as many detractors as fans. Still, if the negativity gets too much, at least he can come home and relax in a nice cold bath. The joy and sadness of being surpassed by your kids The spousal sleep disparity Cancel Christmas.
